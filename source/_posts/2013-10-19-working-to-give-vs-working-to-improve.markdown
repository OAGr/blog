The de facto wisdom within the Effective Altruist community seems to be
that the good that most people pursuing Earning to Give comes primarily
by their donations, rather than the work that produced those donations.

For instance, take a finance professional earning and donated 30% of his/her
income.  This may be approximately $30,000 per year, and it's very easy
to understand how this money improves the world if spent wisely.  At a
lower bound (for those who believe in even more important causes), this
money would directly fund malaria nets via the AMF, saving approximately
15 lives and preventing more sicknesses.  It's much more difficult to
estimate the impact of the more direct labor that the professional provides via their work in finance.  However, given the magnitude of the benefit from the donation, it generally been been assumed that the direct work is significantly less useful to society.  

Still, I hear some claims that "Working to Give" in conventional fields
like finance or software development (as opposed to unconventional
fields like meta-research) may be as impactful or more-so than "Working
to Give."  The primary example that comes to mind is Holden, Exective
Director of Givewell, who has stated, 


Claim #1: Some careers provide many (10-10,000x) times the work benefit
as others.
Claim #2: If some "decent" careers are approximately as useful as
donations to the AMF, then "amazing" careers must be substantially
better still.
Claim #3: If "Working to Give" were more impactful than "Earning to
Give", then donations to work education may be substantially more
important than ones to existing Givewell approved charities. 
Claim #4: For most software engineers, "Earning to Give" is much more
useful than "Working to Give".  

##Claim 1
Consider the following careers.  How much value or utility to you think each one of
them produces to the world through their work?  

 - A high-frequency trader
 - A pornography website host / web engineer
 - A Farmville advertising engineer
 - A LinkedIn email marketing automater.
 - A software engineer at Google
 - A software engineer at Google.org (their 'do-good' division)
 - The Wikipedia software team

I'm going to guess that almost everyone would agree that at least one or
two of these provide negligible or negative world value.  There seem to
be zero-sum markets where benefits to one firm directly result in less
profit to another, like high-frequency trading.  In other markets, web
companies definitely do things that aren't in the benefit of most
people.  For example, I bet that most spam emails are a net negative for
society, and yet web companies have entire departments set around
spreading these. 

On the other hand, there have been some software projects that
definitely have been quite useful.  Wikipedia comes across as one that started out with a tiny team but produced what seems to be lots of value.  So did Wikileaks.  Peter Singer recently mentioned that he considers that work for internet services in developing countries could provide huge returns.  So there have been software engineers / hackers who have provided lots
of utility (though the amount is unclear), and others in different
fields who have likely produced very little.

Perhaps more obvious is the fact that most other fields seem to have
power laws when describing the amount of world benefit provided.  We
know that in the charity sector some charities are at least 10-1000x as
efficient at others at converting money into utility.  With individual
researchers this seems to be the case, with entire research fields it
seems to be the case.  The 80/20 principal appears incredibly common,
and it would be very surprising to me if it didn't exist in terms of the
benefits in different jobs.  Therefore it seems very likely that
different careers would provide expected output utility of different
orders of magnitude.

##Claim 2
If it's true that average employees or software engineers produce more
value in their work than in their donations(if spent optimally), it seems like careers that produce results 10-100x as high would make the AMF donations inconsequential in comparison.  This would appear to just be common sense if one assumes a Power Law.

##Claim 3
If it's true that for people who choose "efficient careers", they will
produce 10-100x as much value from their work than their donations, then
what's by far the most important is that they maximize their work rather
than that they maximize their donations.  If this is true, we should be
doing much more of the following.

### 1: Personal Education & Training to Insane Levels
Personal coaches and tons of investment in self promotion would be in
order, to very high amounts.  

$80,000 per year, $20,000 donated per year.  

20x as efficient as donation, so that's effectively $400,000 of world
productive value per year.

A 5% improvement in productivity would be worth %20,000.  My guess is
that $20,000 of money spent on personal efficiency could go much further
than increase productivity by 5%.  $20,000 per year would be about $1.7k
per month.  This could buy you several monthly coaching sessions, food
and all home issues dealt with by fancy personal assistants, home
cleaning etc.  

Much of this would be to work as much as possible to produce as much
output as possible.  Weekends and long nights as much as one doesn't
burn out or could sustain.  

### 2: Very high investment in one's happiness

### 2: Investment in education of others. 

##Claim 4  So my guess is that anything matters.  It also includes that nothing is really what it would seem	 otherwi
