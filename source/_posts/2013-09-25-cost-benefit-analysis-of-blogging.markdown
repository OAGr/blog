Recently I've written a short stream of short posts.  They take quite a
while (2-8 Pomodoros each), so I've been trying to figure out how useful
they really are.  Here are some costs and benefits I've come up with.  I
realize that typically only a few will carry the vast majority of the
importance (see the [Pareto Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle)) so have indicated my impressions of the importance of each one.

### Benefits
- **Idea Dissemination (Important)**  
  Take my ideas from inside my head and provide
  them for the world!  The obvious reason for blogging.  Can be somewhat
measured by tracking visitors, reading comments, and talking to readers.   

- **Online Credibility (Important)**  
  I find that reading someone's blog is one of the best ways to know
them, particularly if they are an introvert.  Blogging is a good way to
show others that you're generally thoughtful and intelligent.  

- **Experience Writing (Slightly Important)**  
  Writing is a useful skill to have, and practice makes one better.
With blogs there is some feedback as well as a clear incentive to
improve.  Blog writing seems quite similar to book writing and report
writing, which are two fields that a lot of important people seem to
need.  
  I could probably improve this a lot by focussing in on each of the
following.
    - Quality  
        If I'm spending 4 hours writing a post, it may make sense to
spend $5-$20 (oDesk perhaps) on an editor, mainly for the feedback to improve it.  This
may also take another 1-3 hours per post.
        I assume I could measure quality improvement by going back to my
old essays and seeing if they are obviously worse.  If not, perhaps I
haven't improved.
    - Speed  
        Recently I have been measuring the number of Pomodoros my
writing has taken me.  I'll try to post future numbers along with
future posts.    
- **Idea Generation (Very Important)**  
  Writing blog posts forces me to lay out my ideas and ideate on them
enough to produce something somewhat coherent.  This may be the most
valuable aspect, now that I reflect on this.  My reports/longer posts
have forced me to do analysis and reference external materials.  
  I imagine I could measure this a bit by looking back and judging how
much of my current thought process is directly because of research from
my previous blog posts.  This may be quite considerable.
- **Personal Reference (Very Slightly Important)**  
  I would like to keep track of what I know.  I could somewhat measure
this by keeping track of how often I actually go back to read previous
material.  So far the answer is not often for the vast majority, but
occationally for the most important papers.  Much of the reference seems
only useful so far as for me to see if I'm improving as a writer, for
reasons mentioned above.

### Costs
- **Time to Write (Opportunity Cost) (Important)**  
  My work flow with Octopress is somewhat complicated, and as of now it
takes me at least 2 Pomodoros (one hour of intense concentration) to
write a small post.  My previous on on the Epistemologies of Effective
Altruist Groups took me a good 4-6 hours to write, effectively the most
productive part of my Saturday.  I stopped tracking Pomodoros for a
while as I started grinding (this is normally a bad idea in my
experience).  This definitely was far more than I was expecting and I
could have gotten a lot of work done for 80,000 Hours in that time.  
  I estimate that so far my blog (this specific one, not my old one) has
taken me about 20 hours to set up and about 15 hours to write on (around
7 posts in that time).  If my time is worth $50 an hour, that means that
this cost me almost $2k so far.  I'm currently very low on money so this
is a lot to me.  

- **Time to Socialize (Opportunity Cost) (Important)**  
  I split this up for transparency and because it's not very obvious.  I
find that so far for each blog post I write, I tend to spend at least
30 minutes to 2 hours checking & replying to comments, seeing Facebook
likes, and looking at Google Analytics.  I could reduce this with
discipline.  One reason why I'm worried about changing to LessWrong is
that I may spend a lot of time replying to comments there (it would seem
rude not to).  

- **Attention (Not Very Important)**  
  When I've been blogging I've noticed that I've thought a lot about new
topics.  This attention is incredibly hard to quantify.  I expect it
isn't too important to consider here, because these seem like good
things for me to come up with anyway.

### What Do You Think?
Do any of you have input in the order and/or importance of these costs
and benefits?  Ideally we could eventually put together a Fermi
estimate, but some of these are really difficult to estimate.

#### Blog Efficiency
This post took me approximately 3.5 Pomodoros to write and publish.
While writing it I started 2 other blog posts which I would like to soon
finish (one of which took another 0.5 Pomodoros). This post is around 900 words, so this results in around 250 words per Pomodoro, or 10 words per minute.) One of these new blog posts includes
details on my existing blog traffic to provide insight to some of the
above.  I would love to write a rigorous analysis of each, but it would
take quite a long time.
