Sentiment Analysis on Mechanical Turk

The interface is relatively simple.  You pick  an item (a slogan, for example), a question ("rate how much you like this slogan"), and then upload a .csv file with a list of all the possible slogans you want to test out.  You can choose anywhere between 10-20 ratings for each, which we've found to give a pretty consistant response. We tried out this technique with several slogan ideas we were considering.  But before I show you the response, try guessing the order that people preferred the following list:
- "Eyes Save Lives"
- "Charity Done Right"
- "Donate Without Paying"
- "We Give You Superpowers"
- "Help Things You Care About"
- "Join the Mission, Save the World"

Our first test included 15 titles, each which had 10 votes.  At $0.02 per vote, that's $3.00 (plus a bit extra for using Turk), which is ridiculously cheap for market research. When all the votes come in, you can see an analysis that looks like this:
