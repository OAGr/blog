The domain [ ifwehadglass.com](http://www.ifwehadglass.com/) was available, so I decided to go with it.  Then I searched iStock Photo for an image somewhat similar to the google one, but with more people.  I found one, made a [Twitter page](https://twitter.com/ifwehadglass), made a [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/572165209460571/), and finally started a website.  Taking significant inspiration from the Google Glass website, I put together some custom CSS to make my own similar version, as shown below.

Submitted it on Hacker News hoping to make front page.   [Kind of did.](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5261470)  Hacker News (selected) reactions below.

Some attempts were made at getting someone from Google to come with a Google Glass for the event, but they were made in vain.  Fortunately, the event was fun for the people who made it.  The run-down will come in the next post.
