[caption id="attachment\_108" align="alignnone" width="922"] [ ![Me with earmuffs over ear plugs](http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/photo-on-2-15-13-at-2-59-pm.jpg?w=922) ](http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/photo-on-2-15-13-at-2-59-pm.jpg) Me with earmuffs over ear plugs in a coffee shop[/caption] Living in a house of [18 people](http://www.risesf.com/ "The Rise SF") can be quite loud, especially for someone working at home.  After going part insane I finally got some [professional earmuffs](http://www.amazon.com/3M-Peltor-H10A-Optime-Earmuff/dp/B00009LI4K/ref=sr_1_8?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1360969325&sr=1-8&keywords=headphones) to help deal with it.  I think they dampen sound by about 30dB, which is pretty good when paired with ear buds underneath.  Most earmuffs are marketed at gun hobbyists.  It's a pity, because I bet there are a bunch more introverts out there who would find them more valuable. $30 for quiet, $20 if you can wait a few days for them to come from Amazon.  Highly recommended if you don't mind the silly look.
