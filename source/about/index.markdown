![Me in Oxford, 2013](/assets/pages/about/me.png)
I'm Ozzie Gooen.  I am currently working on web development at [80,000
Hours](http://80000hours.org).  You can contact me at
<ozzie.gooen@80000hours.org>. 

## Work & College

I've included much of my previous work information on my [LinkedIn
Account](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=89729703&goback=%2Enmp_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1&trk=spm_pic).  I'm not a big fan of LinkedIn but realize that it's generally a good place for these things.

## Personality

According to a [IPIP-NEO](http://www.personalitytest.net/ipip/ipipneo1.htm) report, a version of the "Big 5" that I took in October 2013, my results are as follows.  

* Extroversion: 61/100  
* Agreeableness: 68/100  
* Conscientiousness: 56/100 
* Neuroticism: 45/100  
* Openness: 82/100  

My results in further detail and my takes on it have been written up
[here](/about/personality.html).
