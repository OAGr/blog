    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Here at <a href="http://80000hours.org">80,000 Hours</a> we’re currently working to make a rubric to rate our research/blog quality.  My first step was to do a minor literature survey, and outline of which is given below.  You can also read and contribute to it on <a href="https://workflowy.com/shared/cb311015-0619-e9bc-9cb6-42ea79e9a2f1/">Workflowy</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>One of the main benefits of rubrics is for writing and learning, using them as a guideline, as opposed to only ranking things that have been done <span class="certainty">~c3</span>.  As such, a rubric could provide a lot of value to help us decide and find a consistent style of article <span class="certainty"> ~c1i1</span>.</li>
  <li>Often numbers are less important than written feedback, especially for improvement <span class="certainty">~c1i1</span>.</li>
  <li>It’s really important to have the “students” or “writers” help build the rubric <span class="certainty">~c1i1</span>.</li>
  <li>It’s possible to use rubric to decrease variance in scores.  However, it’s also possible that rubrics will increase variance in scores.  While there does not seem to be a ton of research in what kinds of rubrics improve precision, it seems like this should be considered and efforts should be made to make sure that the rubric is very clear <span class="certainty">~c1i1</span>.</li>

          <li>Conclusions
            <ul>
              <li>This paper aimed to review empirical research and illuminate the questions of how the use of rubrics can (1) enhance the reliability of scoring, (2) facilitate valid judgment of performance assessments, and (3) give positive educational consequences, such as promoting learning and/or improve instruction.</li>
              <li>A first conclusion is that the reliable scoring of performance assessments can be enhanced by the use of rubrics. In relation to reliability issues, rubrics should be analytic, topic-specific, and complemented with exemplars and/or rater training. Since performance assessments are more or less open ended per definition, it is not always possible to restrict the assessment format to achieve high levels of reliability without sacrificing the validity.</li>
              <li>Another conclusion is that rubrics do not facilitate valid judgment of performance assessments per se. Valid assessment could be facilitated by using a more comprehensive framework of validity when validating the rubric, instead of focusing on only one or two aspects of validity. In relation to learning and instruction, consequential validity is an aspect of validity that might need further attention.</li>
              <li>Furthermore, it has been concluded that rubrics seem to have the potential of promoting learning and/or improve instruction. The main reason for this potential lies in the fact that rubrics make expectations and criteria explicit, which also facilitates feedback and self-assessment. It is thus argued that assessment quality criteria should emphasize dimensions like transparency and fitness for self-assessment to a greater extent than is done through the traditional reliability and validity criteria. This could be achieved through a framework of quality criteria that acknowledges the importance of trustworthiness in assessment as well as supports a more comprehensive view on validity issues (including educational consequences).</li>

          <li>“Two studies suggested that rubric use was associated with improved academic performance, while one did not.”</li>
          <li>“Studies of the validity of rubrics have shown that clarity and appropriateness of language is a central concern. Studies of rater reliability tend to show that rubrics can lead to a relatively common interpretation of student performance”</li>
          <li>“Little attention has been paid to the validity of rubrics.  Most of the work has been on reliability - a necessary but insufficient condition of validity.</li>
          <li>“The language used in rubrics is considered to be one of the most challenging aspects of its design (Tierney and Simon 2004; Moni, Beswick, and Moni 2005). As with any form of assessment, the clarity of the language in a rubric is a matter of validity because an ambiguous rubric cannot be accurately or consistently interpreted by instructors, students or scorers (Payne 2003).

          <li>“raters must be sufficiently trained in order to achieve acceptable levels of reliability (typically 70% agreement or higher).”</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Recently I spent some time researching Transparency, after preparing to write a few posts about it.  While originally I wanted to treat “Transparency” as a singular phenomena, the existing literature on it suggests that there really is no coherent idea of “Transparency”, but rather a set of several competing notions used in different fields<span class="certainty">~c1i3</span>.  For example, “Company Transparency” seems to refer a lot to having a nice company blog, while “Nonprofit Transparency” is often about the financials<span class="certainty">~c1i2</span>.  </p>

<p>This is what I have recorded from about one day of research on the topic.  I hope to look through some of the books and articles in more detail later on, this so far was just a broad overview. </p>

<p>I took these notes in a Workflowy <a href="https://workflowy.com/shared/de1355ef-35e1-7e27-cc34-8e48c4162d67/">here</a>, which I think is the easiest way to access (and contribute) to this<span class="certainty">~i2</span>.  However, I have also exported the notes below for convenience.  Fortunately the ‘export’ workflowy feature works very well with Markdown.</p>

              <li>My take: It gets some good reviews, some terrible ones.  Seems to me like an ‘open source is awesome’ promotion without much substance in the specific issues of what transparency is or how to implement it.</li>
              <li>Author seems to be quite a figure.  See this quote in his biography:
“ “…three Washington tours (counterintelligence, information technology, DCI’s vault for all technical systems), CIA Mid-Career Course, invited by Marine Corps to come back as a GS-14 to help created the Marine Corps Intelligence Center, did that. That was also my fork in the road. Discovered that the secret world is largely worthless in supporting all policy, all acquisition, all operations, and totally absent in supporting Whole of Government, public education, and public research. Started the modern Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) movement against very strong resistance from CIA, went on the train 7,500 mid-career officers from across 66+ countries, wrote the DIA, NATO, and SOF OSINT Handbooks. Created a for-profit (Open Source Solutions Network, now closed) and a non-profit (Earth Intelligence Network, 501c3, lying fallow). “</li>

          <li>Give the Emperor a Mirror: Toward Developing a Stakeholder Measurement of Organizational Transparency</li>
          <li>Abstract:
“The concept of organizational transparency has vaulted to prominence in recent years. While the virtues of transparency have been tied to trust and credibility, there have been no efforts to measure this abstract concept. Guidelines exist to help organizations be more transparent, but the real test is how stakeholders perceive an organization’s transparency. This paper focuses on developing a stakeholder measurement of organizational transparency. Factor analyses, structural equation models, and reliability alphas on the measurement items indicate the instrument measures three transparency reputation traits (integrity, respect for others, openness) and four transparency efforts (participation, substantial information, accountability, and secrecy).”</li>

              <li>The foundation stone of international norms for transparency was the 1923 International Convention Relating to the Simplification of Customs Formalities (“Customs Convention”).9 The Customs Convention established rules for transparency and review at the national level.10 All customs regulations were required to be promptly published “in such a manner as to enable persons concerned to become acquainted with them and to avoid the prejudice which might result from the application of customs formalities of which they are ignorant.”11 </li>

          <li>Summary: This was a short story of a CEO who blogged a lot followed by some discussion that “reputation online is everything.”  This is considered by him to be “Radical Transparency.”</li>
          <li>Quotes
            <ul>
              <li>“Nearly everyone I spoke to had a warning for would-be transparent CEOs: You can’t go halfway naked. It’s all or nothing. Executives who promise they’ll be open have to stay open. The minute they become evasive about troubling news, transparency’s implied social compact crumbles.”</li>
              <li>“The reputation economy creates an incentive to be more open, not less. Since Internet commentary is inescapable, the only way to influence it is to be part of it. Being transparent, opening up, posting interesting material frequently and often is the only way to amass positive links to yourself and thus to directly influence your Googleable reputation.”</li>

              <li>My take
                <ul>
                  <li>A very pretty report that rates a multinational companies on a few “transparency” questionnaires, specifically focussing on corruption.</li>
                  <li>The Questionnaire in some ways is the best part.  They have three indexes, each with a list of different questions.

                  <li>“To head off such PR catastrophes, the authors recommend a policy of “transparency,” whereby companies disclose all possible information, a practice they feel boosts employee morale and performance, facilitates business partnerships, and helps responsible corporations attract socially conscious consumers and investors.”</li>

                  <li>My take: It gets some good reviews, some terrible ones.  Seems to me like an ‘open source is awesome’ promotion without much substance in the specific issues of what transparency is or how to implement it.</li>

“ “…three Washington tours (counterintelligence, information technology, DCI’s vault for all technical systems), CIA Mid-Career Course, invited by Marine Corps to come back as a GS-14 to help created the Marine Corps Intelligence Center, did that. That was also my fork in the road. Discovered that the secret world is largely worthless in supporting all policy, all acquisition, all operations, and totally absent in supporting Whole of Government, public education, and public research. Started the modern Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) movement against very strong resistance from CIA, went on the train 7,500 mid-career officers from across 66+ countries, wrote the DIA, NATO, and SOF OSINT Handbooks. Created a for-profit (Open Source Solutions Network, now closed) and a non-profit (Earth Intelligence Network, 501c3, lying fallow). “</li>

Simply looking at other people isn’t enough to achieve this transparency, nor does looking seek to do so. - See more at: http://asymptotejournal.com/article.php?cat=Nonfiction&amp;id=23&amp;curr_index=0#sthash.eCkfKthK.dpuf”</li>

              <li>Give the Emperor a Mirror: Toward Developing a Stakeholder Measurement of Organizational Transparency</li>
              <li>Abstract:
“The concept of organizational transparency has vaulted to prominence in recent years. While the virtues of transparency have been tied to trust and credibility, there have been no efforts to measure this abstract concept. Guidelines exist to help organizations be more transparent, but the real test is how stakeholders perceive an organization’s transparency. This paper focuses on developing a stakeholder measurement of organizational transparency. Factor analyses, structural equation models, and reliability alphas on the measurement items indicate the instrument measures three transparency reputation traits (integrity, respect for others, openness) and four transparency efforts (participation, substantial information, accountability, and secrecy).”</li>

              <li>Quotes
                <ul>
                  <li>“Nearly everyone I spoke to had a warning for would-be transparent CEOs: You can’t go halfway naked. It’s all or nothing. Executives who promise they’ll be open have to stay open. The minute they become evasive about troubling news, transparency’s implied social compact crumbles.”</li>
                  <li>“The reputation economy creates an incentive to be more open, not less. Since Internet commentary is inescapable, the only way to influence it is to be part of it. Being transparent, opening up, posting interesting material frequently and often is the only way to amass positive links to yourself and thus to directly influence your Googleable reputation.”</li>

    <updated>2013-10-19T19:04:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://ozziegooen.com/blog/2013/10/19/working-to-give-vs-working-to-improve</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The de facto wisdom within the Effective Altruist community seems to be
that the good that most people pursuing Earning to Give comes primarily
by their donations, rather than the work that produced those donations.</p>

<p>For instance, take a finance professional earning and donated 30% of his/her
income.  This may be approximately $30,000 per year, and it’s very easy
to understand how this money improves the world if spent wisely.  At a
lower bound (for those who believe in even more important causes), this
money would directly fund malaria nets via the AMF, saving approximately
15 lives and preventing more sicknesses.  It’s much more difficult to
estimate the impact of the more direct labor that the professional provides via their work in finance.  However, given the magnitude of the benefit from the donation, it generally been been assumed that the direct work is significantly less useful to society.  </p>

<p>Still, I hear some claims that “Working to Give” in conventional fields
like finance or software development (as opposed to unconventional
fields like meta-research) may be as impactful or more-so than “Working
to Give.”  The primary example that comes to mind is Holden, Exective
Director of Givewell, who has stated, </p>

<p>Claim #1: Some careers provide many (10-10,000x) times the work benefit
as others.
Claim #2: If some “decent” careers are approximately as useful as
donations to the AMF, then “amazing” careers must be substantially
better still.
Claim #3: If “Working to Give” were more impactful than “Earning to
Give”, then donations to work education may be substantially more
important than ones to existing Givewell approved charities. 
Claim #4: For most software engineers, “Earning to Give” is much more
useful than “Working to Give”.  </p>

<h2 id="claim-1">Claim 1</h2>
<p>Consider the following careers.  How much value or utility to you think each one of
them produces to the world through their work?  </p>

<ul>
  <li>A high-frequency trader</li>
  <li>A pornography website host / web engineer</li>
  <li>A Farmville advertising engineer</li>
  <li>A LinkedIn email marketing automater.</li>
  <li>A software engineer at Google</li>
  <li>A software engineer at Google.org (their ‘do-good’ division)</li>
  <li>The Wikipedia software team</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m going to guess that almost everyone would agree that at least one or
two of these provide negligible or negative world value.  There seem to
be zero-sum markets where benefits to one firm directly result in less
profit to another, like high-frequency trading.  In other markets, web
companies definitely do things that aren’t in the benefit of most
people.  For example, I bet that most spam emails are a net negative for
society, and yet web companies have entire departments set around
spreading these. </p>

<p>On the other hand, there have been some software projects that
definitely have been quite useful.  Wikipedia comes across as one that started out with a tiny team but produced what seems to be lots of value.  So did Wikileaks.  Peter Singer recently mentioned that he considers that work for internet services in developing countries could provide huge returns.  So there have been software engineers / hackers who have provided lots
of utility (though the amount is unclear), and others in different
fields who have likely produced very little.</p>

<p>Perhaps more obvious is the fact that most other fields seem to have
power laws when describing the amount of world benefit provided.  We
know that in the charity sector some charities are at least 10-1000x as
efficient at others at converting money into utility.  With individual
researchers this seems to be the case, with entire research fields it
seems to be the case.  The 80/20 principal appears incredibly common,
and it would be very surprising to me if it didn’t exist in terms of the
benefits in different jobs.  Therefore it seems very likely that
different careers would provide expected output utility of different
orders of magnitude.</p>

<h2 id="claim-2">Claim 2</h2>
<p>If it’s true that average employees or software engineers produce more
value in their work than in their donations(if spent optimally), it seems like careers that produce results 10-100x as high would make the AMF donations inconsequential in comparison.  This would appear to just be common sense if one assumes a Power Law.</p>

<h2 id="claim-3">Claim 3</h2>
<p>If it’s true that for people who choose “efficient careers”, they will
produce 10-100x as much value from their work than their donations, then
what’s by far the most important is that they maximize their work rather
than that they maximize their donations.  If this is true, we should be
doing much more of the following.</p>

<h3 id="personal-education--training-to-insane-levels">1: Personal Education &amp; Training to Insane Levels</h3>
<p>Personal coaches and tons of investment in self promotion would be in
order, to very high amounts.  </p>

<p>$80,000 per year, $20,000 donated per year.  </p>

<p>20x as efficient as donation, so that’s effectively $400,000 of world
productive value per year.</p>

<p>A 5% improvement in productivity would be worth %20,000.  My guess is
that $20,000 of money spent on personal efficiency could go much further
than increase productivity by 5%.  $20,000 per year would be about $1.7k
per month.  This could buy you several monthly coaching sessions, food
and all home issues dealt with by fancy personal assistants, home
cleaning etc.  </p>

<p>Much of this would be to work as much as possible to produce as much
output as possible.  Weekends and long nights as much as one doesn’t
burn out or could sustain.  </p>

    <link href="http://ozziegooen.com/blog/2013/10/18/creating-a-text-shorthand-for-uncertainty/"/>
    <updated>2013-10-18T22:22:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://ozziegooen.com/blog/2013/10/18/creating-a-text-shorthand-for-uncertainty</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Most things I discuss are highly uncertain, but it can be really
confusing and wordy to state that uncertainty in writing.  In this last
sentence for example I felt the need to write “I find” to point out
uncertainty, for example.</p>

<p>First, people are really bad at agreeing on probabilities.  So if I say
something is “very certain”, that could mean 80% chance  to me and
95% chance to you.  This is rigorously explained in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Failure-Risk-Management-Broken-ebook/dp/B0026LTMAU/ref=la_B001JSJHIS_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1380144451&amp;sr=1-2">Failure
of Risk Management</a> (by the same author from How to Measure Anything), where it is explained further to say that this is especially true of risk managers.  </p>

<p>Second, there aren’t too many words to use to indicate uncertainty.  I
find that I need to repeat the same ones over and over again.  And when
they are used, these words can be quite wordy and confusing.   </p>

<ul>
  <li><em>I think</em> that</li>
  <li><em>In my opinion</em></li>
  <li>It <em>makes sense</em> that</li>
  <li>There aren’t <em>too</em> many things</li>
  <li><em>Perhaps,</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Several years ago some people made the language <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime">E-Prime</a> in large part
to make this uncertainty crystal clear.<br />
&gt;  E-Prime (short for English-Prime, sometimes denoted É or E′) is a prescriptive version of the English language that excludes all forms of the verb to be. E-Prime does not allow the conjugations of to be—be, am, is, are, was, were, been, being— the archaic forms of to be (e.g. art, wast, wert), or the contractions of to be—’s, ‘m, ‘re (e.g. I’m, he’s, she’s, they’re).<br />
Some scholars advocate using E-Prime as a device to clarify thinking and strengthen writing.[1] For example, the sentence “the film was good” could not be expressed under the rules of E-Prime, and the speaker might instead say “I liked the film” or “the film made me laugh”. The E-Prime versions communicate the speaker’s experience rather than judgment, making it harder for the writer or reader to confuse opinion with fact.</p>

<p>While I do intend to look more into E-prime, it seems like a bit much to
use on a regular level.</p>

<h2 id="a-possible-written-solution">A Possible (Written) Solution</h2>
<p>I propose that we instead use a symbol at the end of our sentences or
propositions to indicate uncertainty.  </p>

<h3 id="choosing-the-levels">Choosing the Levels</h3>
<p>A scale would have to be created of course in order to indicate what these levels are.  My guess
is that the optimal (for usefulness, popularity, and accuracy) amount of
levels would be around 5-10, especially because we aren’t very good at
accessing probability.  </p>

<p>Here’s one example that makes sense to me:<br />
0. ~50%
1. ~65%
2. ~80%
3. ~90%
4. ~95%
5. ~99.9%</p>

<p>In cases where something is <em>unlikely</em>, this would just work the
opposite way (50% to 0.01%).</p>

<h3 id="choosing-a-symbol">Choosing a Symbol</h3>
<p>I think that any representation of certainty would have to be achievable
with ASCII characters, if not the English keyboard.  Here are some
possibilities.  Each is shown to be representative for a level of 4/5,
according to a scale similar to what is shown above.</p>

<h4 id="non-numeric-forms">Non-Numeric forms</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The universe is expanding.’’’’</li>
  <li>The universe is expanding.&#8220;&#8220;</li>
  <li>The universe is expanding.`</li>
  <li>The universe is expanding. ····</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="numeric-forms">Numeric Forms</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The universe is expanding. `4</li>
  <li>The universe is expanding.4*</li>
  <li>The universe is expanding (~4).</li>
  <li>The universe is expanding (c~4).</li>
  <li>The universe is expanding (c4).</li>
  <li>The universe is expanding ~c4.</li>
  <li>The universe is expanding (?4).</li>
</ul>

<p>My personal favorite at this point is to have a number with the tilda
sign “~”, with a symbol for indication (like the “c” or “?”).  The dashes are be
difficult to read and more confusing to newcomers (c3).   </p>

<h2 id="different-kinds-of-uncertainty">Different Kinds of Uncertainty</h2>
<p>So far we’ve assumed that the definition of ‘uncertainty’ is relatively
clear, but sometimes there are different definitions of uncertainty.</p>

<p>For instance, there’s the certainty of “the existing scientific
literature strongly agrees that evolution is true”, and the certainty of
“I personally am very certain that the Paleo diet is good, even though
others might disagree.”  </p>

<p>These could be indicated by different symbols.  This would require a
small dictionary of symbols/standards, but this may not be very
unreasonable.</p>

<p>Say we use ‘c’ to indicate ‘consensus’ and ‘i’ to indicate ‘personal
intuition’, and ‘r’ to indicate ‘personal research/rationality’.  Not
all of these would need to be used in every instance, only the ones that
are instantially relevant. </p>

<p>Some statements could be as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The universe is expanding ~c5.  </li>
  <li>I’m not likely to do well in finance ~i4c1r2.  </li>
  <li>Polyphasic sleep has a lot of potential ~r4c1.</li>
  <li>I was a poor math student ~i4r2 in high school, but have learned a lot
~i3r2 since then.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, we’d need a definition for this, which is effectively a
standard.  For now I’ll call it “Uncertainty Notation V0.1”  I’ll try it
out in future posts as an experiment.

<p>I believe that this blog post took me approximately 4-7 hours to write,
plus another 2-10 hours to discuss / brainstorm on.  Of course, much of
that resulted in other thoughts that have not yet been put into this

<p>Everyone rationalizes things.  It seems to be our default decision process.  If your friends and loved ones seem to be lieing about their reasons for things, it may simply mean that they are human.  It’s quite possible that they don’t even realize it.</p>

<p>Rather than fighting each one of the thousand-headed beast of renewable arguments, its seems best to either <strong>let the decision be</strong> or to bring discussion to humanity’s faulty decision creation modes.  </p>

<h3 id="lesson-2-because-i-feel-like-it-is-often-the-correct-answer">Lesson #2: “Because I feel like it” is often the correct answer.</h3>
<p>It’s often the truth, and making up reasons for things could sometimes
be counter-productive, especially when you’re not sure those reasons
exist.  Intuitions can be incredibly good, especially in disciplines of
tight feedback in areas that one has practice in.  This is discussed
thoroughly in the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-We-Decide-Jonah-Lehrer/dp/0547247990/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1379537330&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=how+to+decide">How We Decide</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction--why-i-wrote-this">Introduction / Why I Wrote This</h2>
<p>The charity sector has made a <a href="http://www.transparency.org/">big</a> <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/emc/2013/08/29/givewell-how-data-transparency-leads-donors-to-better-charitable-giving/">deal</a> out of ‘transparency’ recently.  Here at <a href="http://80000hours.org/">80,000 Hours</a> (I work there now) there’s a lot of talk about how we and similar organizations could become more ‘transparent’.  One discussed aim is to be more ‘transparent’ than <a href="http://givewell.org/">Givewell</a>, which in general is the gold standard of ‘transparency’ within the small field.  </p>

<p>I’ve had discussions with many people who had many ideas on this topic.  Eventually it dawned on me that I had little idea of what ‘transparency’ even meant.  On
further reflection, I don’t think many of these people did either.  Some
organizations have quantized transparency indexes into rubrics (<a href="http://www.bicusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/WBG+Transparency+Scorecard.pdf">see that
for the World Bank</a>, for example), but it wasn’t obvious what the rubrics were trying to estimate.  I desired an ideal quantification of transparency that can be approximated in rubrics, rather than rubrics that match a general intuitive understanding of transparency.</p>

<p>I should also be clear that I am extremely demanding in what I want in
definitions.  I’m an engineer by training, I want to work with things I
can quantify and model in the same ways I do Force and Velocity.
Important ideas considered currently ‘soft’ or non-technical feel like challenges to
define better.  I realize that actual measurements may be extremely
difficult, but this doesn’t mean that we can’t make estimates of
substantial value.  This definition attempt is me attempting to take my
intuitive understanding of this word ‘transparency’ and match it to
something technical and clear.</p>

<p>I don’t claim to have solved this problem, but I believe I’ve taken a
few interesting steps.  Hopefully we will eventually create a
transparency rubric for effective altruist organizations, and I now have
a much better understanding to begin with.</p>

<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
<p>Quite simply, I am currently using the working model that transparency
is defined as,
&gt; The total expected value of information delivered by a system, about itself.</p>

<p>I believe this definition is intuitive and <em>almost</em> quantifiable.
The use of this definition should lead to more clarity regarding the
term.</p>

<p>While I believe that this definition almost captures the ‘essence’ of
what we mean as ‘transparency’, I also believe that a thorough
evaluation of this essence leads to several facts that may be quite
unintuitive.</p>

<h2 id="information-quality-and-accessibility-are-more-important-than-quantity">#1: Information quality and accessibility are more important than quantity.</h2>

<h3 id="a-few-thought-experiments">A few thought experiments</h3>

<p><strong>1.</strong>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Shields_(diarist)">Reverend Robert Shields</a> had a diary of 37.5 million words.  The following is an example:
&gt;
&gt;  * April 18, 1994 <br />
&gt;      * 6:30-6:35: I put in the oven two Stouffer’s macaroni and cheese at 350°.
&gt;      * 6:35-6:50: I was at the keyboard of the IBM Wheelwriter making entries for the diary.
&gt;      * 6.50-7.30: I ate the Stouffer’s macaroni and cheese and Cornelia ate the other one. Grace decided she didn’t want one.
&gt;      * 7.30-7.35: We changed the light over the back stoop since the bulb had burnt out.</p>

<p>Every detail of Roberts’ thoughts seems to be burried within this
text.  Does this make him completely transparent?  Would this change
depending on the format (physical book, online pdf, online spreadsheet)?</p>

<p>Compare that to Stephen King who published <a href="http://www.amazon.com/On-Writing-ebook/dp/B000FC0SIM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1381602103&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=on+writing">On Writing</a>, a rather short
(320 page) autobiography and set of lessons he learned through that
time.  Would Stephen King have been more <em>transparent</em> had he instead
wrote down his life information minute by minute?</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Say there were a ‘perfect’ and ‘perfectly trusted’ being who evaluated
nonprofits.  They would rate them a ‘1’ if the nonprofit was the “best”
nonprofit, and a ‘0’ otherwise.  Rather than having any mention of what
they do, many nonprofits decide to only display this number on their
website (it would be a very simple website, perhaps with a url chosen to
obfuscate their cause, like charity34234235.com).  Are these charities
being transparent to those trying to find the “best” charity?  Could
they possibly be more so?</p>

<h3 id="my-take">My Take</h3>
<p>‘Transparency’ is only loosely associated with the amount of information
available.  It doesn’t matter how much information is available if it’s
useless, and extra information could easily lead to obfuscation of what
matters.  </p>

<p>When asking for a important organization details about different
charities, I hear a lot of “Oh, we mentioned in the middle of a blog
post a few months ago.”  The conversation typically ends there.  But on
reflection, this information being difficult to find may be much more
important than the fact that it exists somewhere.  The vast majority of
people who may be interested in it will never access it.  I’m fortunate
to be in a place where I can physically speak to many of the knowledge
experts.  Most people aren’t.</p>

<h2 id="transparency-is-typically-relative-to-a-specific-purpose">#2: Transparency is typically relative to a specific purpose.</h2>

<p>If a charity had complete financial records of absolutely all expenses
and revenues, would it make it completely transparent?  What if it had
this material presented cleanly with pretty graphs and signatures from
several top accountants who have thoroughly reviewed it and are willing
to cite it as clean and it’s filed taxes as completely legal?</p>

<p>This is a bad question because “transparency” isn’t well defined.  This
organization may have amazing financial transparency, or transparency
for the purpose of understanding if it is partaking in sketchy or
illegal accounting practices.  But this is clearly a different kind of
accountability than most potential donors would hope for.  Many
registered charities are required by law to have their main finances
accessible on their websites, but this does not make them incredibly
transparent.  Most people would have little idea or interest to read
such documents.  </p>

<p>It’s obvious that there are different “types” or transparency, but I’ll
clarify that to say there are different “purposes” for transparency to
provide.  There’s the “purpose” of transparency to understand if a
nonprofit is committing financial fraud. There’s the “purpose” of
transparency to understand if a nonprofit is effective vs. other
nonprofits when it comes to cause-neutral returns,  or
local town benefits, or social status improvements.</p>

<p>There’s just no such thing as an organization being objectively
“transparent”.  “Transparency” <em>only</em> exists in relation to a specific
purpose. </p>

<p>Going further, it seems like what we think of as “transparency” can be
narrowed down to something similar to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_of_information"><em>value of information</em></a> for specific decisions.</p>

<h3 id="separating-global-transparency-from-local-transparency">Separating ‘Global’ Transparency from ‘Local’ Transparency</h3>

<p>While transparency typically refers to specific purposes, this doesn’t
mean that the total amount of transparency that an organization is
unbounded with an infinite number of possible purposes.  Rather I assume
that there are probably a few purposes that could bring the
substantial majority of benefit.  For instance, a 1-year old child’s
communications would provide informational of tremendous value to their
own health and their parent’s wellbeing.  These could also be used to
provide interesting data in larger studies, but the value from one
individual baby on these may be much less in comparison.  It could also
provide moderate interest to a person considering later having a child,
but this would be considerably less value potential still.</p>

<p>So a ‘total transparency’ score may be able to be estimated based on the
sums of the values from each type of transparency.  This adds complexity
because it would seem to demand information about the decision maker
categories <em>in relation</em> to each other.  Of course, these can be
simplified a lot by just choosing the top three categories and having a
basic ranking among them.</p>

<p>This definition is not <em>too</em> different than the typical intuitive one.
A banking organization would be seen as transparent primarily if it
provides useful information that the government is looking for, and this
information value is likely far more than that of most other domains.  </p>

<h2 id="transparency-includes-marketing-and-branding">#3: Transparency includes marketing and branding.</h2>
<p>I’ve heard a lot of business and nonprofit pitches.  They are almost
universally completely positive about themselves.  </p>

<p>The “business pitch” is exactly the antithesis of a “transparency report” or
“self-evaluation” of any kind.
Clearly, prospective donors would get more “value of information” from a completely unbiased and honest opinion than a sales pitch.  But should we judge these pitches when analyzing an organization’s ‘transparency’?  Or should “marketing materials” be held exempt from any ‘transparency’ analyses?  </p>

<p>My uncomfortable answer is no.  Good business pitches are bad
transparency.  It’s a sacrifice that we seem to be willing to endure,
perhaps that we should.  If this means that essentially no organization
can be completely transparent, then so be it.</p>

<h2 id="negative-transparency-is-possible-and-common">#4: Negative transparency is possible and common.</h2>
<p>If transparency is related to the value of information provided, then 0
transparency would mean 0 information.  There is definitely information
that is <em>worse</em> than 0 information, especially to regular people (as
opposed to rational super-beings).  </p>

<p>A simple example is smoking.  Someone goes to a website to learn
information about smoking, and the website claims authority while
selectively providing evidence for smoking.  The information to the
reader results in a higher likelihood of making a worse decision, so
this information would have substantially negative value.  </p>

<p>Likewise, if a nonprofit could use a terrible argument to convince an
otherwise unbiased individual to donate to a worse cause then they would
have otherwise (“wow, apparently visits to local prisons has been shown
to scare select children from committing crimes!”), then that
information has provided them with negative value.  </p>

<h2 id="internal-transparency-is-often-more-important-than-external-transparency">#5: Internal transparency is often more important than external transparency</h2>

<h2 id="transparency-should-be-judged-as-a-comparison-to-optimality-rather-than-as-an-absolute-value">#6: Transparency should be judged as a comparison to optimality rather than as an absolute value.</h2>
<p>So far I’ve stated that transparency relates to the value of information
provided by an system.  Yet, large organizations can easily provide
extra informational value through their scale as opposed to anything we
would associate with transparent efforts.  It seems intuitive that small
groups should have a “fair playing ground” in comparison.</p>

<p>I think that as opposed to thinking of transparency as directly relating
to the absolute value of information provided, it makes more sense to
think of it in an ‘percentage of optimal’ sense than a ‘total benefit’
one.  This way when we say an organization is doing a ‘good job’ being
‘transparent’, it will always mean that they’re doing relatively well
given what they are capable of.  </p>

<p>A percentage of optimality seems a bit depressing as I’m sure that
‘optimal information value’ would be orders of magnitude higher than
what most, if any, organizations currently provide.  So perhaps rather
than being compared to optimality, organizations can and should be
compared to a bar significantly lower and more realistic.  Perhaps
different standards should created with top bars at different amounts
of optimality.  For instance, most existing transparency rubrics that
I’m aware of probably are quite far from ‘optimal’, but still are quite
useful and likely would correlate decently well with my working
definition of transparency.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that because of diminishing marginal returns,
reaching completely ‘optimal’ transparency, or anything like it, would
likely reduce the efficiency of an organization towards its main goal.
Or, an organization seeking anything other than to maximize transparency
will not and should not get near optimizing transparency.  Rather they
should see that initially high benefits of transparency are worth some
reasoned level of effort and achievement. </p>

    <link href="http://ozziegooen.com/blog/2013/09/25/cost-benefit-analysis-of-blogging/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-25T20:58:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://ozziegooen.com/blog/2013/09/25/cost-benefit-analysis-of-blogging</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I’ve written a short stream of short posts.  They take quite a
while (2-8 Pomodoros each), so I’ve been trying to figure out how useful
they really are.  Here are some costs and benefits I’ve come up with.  I
realize that typically only a few will carry the vast majority of the
importance (see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto Principle</a>) so have indicated my impressions of the importance of each one.</p>

<h3 id="benefits">Benefits</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Idea Dissemination (Important)</strong><br />
Take my ideas from inside my head and provide
them for the world!  The obvious reason for blogging.  Can be somewhat
measured by tracking visitors, reading comments, and talking to readers.   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Online Credibility (Important)</strong><br />
I find that reading someone’s blog is one of the best ways to know
them, particularly if they are an introvert.  Blogging is a good way to
show others that you’re generally thoughtful and intelligent.  </p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Experience Writing (Slightly Important)</strong><br />
Writing is a useful skill to have, and practice makes one better.
With blogs there is some feedback as well as a clear incentive to
improve.  Blog writing seems quite similar to book writing and report
writing, which are two fields that a lot of important people seem to
need.<br />
I could probably improve this a lot by focussing in on each of the
following.
    <ul>
      <li>Quality<br />
  If I’m spending 4 hours writing a post, it may make sense to
spend $5-$20 (oDesk perhaps) on an editor, mainly for the feedback to improve it.  This
may also take another 1-3 hours per post.
  I assume I could measure quality improvement by going back to my
old essays and seeing if they are obviously worse.  If not, perhaps I
haven’t improved.</li>
      <li>Speed<br />
  Recently I have been measuring the number of Pomodoros my
writing has taken me.  I’ll try to post future numbers along with
future posts.    </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Idea Generation (Very Important)</strong><br />
Writing blog posts forces me to lay out my ideas and ideate on them
enough to produce something somewhat coherent.  This may be the most
valuable aspect, now that I reflect on this.  My reports/longer posts
have forced me to do analysis and reference external materials.<br />
I imagine I could measure this a bit by looking back and judging how
much of my current thought process is directly because of research from
my previous blog posts.  This may be quite considerable.</li>
  <li><strong>Personal Reference (Very Slightly Important)</strong><br />
I would like to keep track of what I know.  I could somewhat measure
this by keeping track of how often I actually go back to read previous
material.  So far the answer is not often for the vast majority, but
occationally for the most important papers.  Much of the reference seems
only useful so far as for me to see if I’m improving as a writer, for
reasons mentioned above.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="costs">Costs</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Time to Write (Opportunity Cost) (Important)</strong><br />
My work flow with Octopress is somewhat complicated, and as of now it
takes me at least 2 Pomodoros (one hour of intense concentration) to
write a small post.  My previous on on the Epistemologies of Effective
Altruist Groups took me a good 4-6 hours to write, effectively the most
productive part of my Saturday.  I stopped tracking Pomodoros for a
while as I started grinding (this is normally a bad idea in my
experience).  This definitely was far more than I was expecting and I
could have gotten a lot of work done for 80,000 Hours in that time.<br />
I estimate that so far my blog (this specific one, not my old one) has
taken me about 20 hours to set up and about 15 hours to write on (around
7 posts in that time).  If my time is worth $50 an hour, that means that
this cost me almost $2k so far.  I’m currently very low on money so this
is a lot to me.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Time to Socialize (Opportunity Cost) (Important)</strong><br />
I split this up for transparency and because it’s not very obvious.  I
find that so far for each blog post I write, I tend to spend at least
30 minutes to 2 hours checking &amp; replying to comments, seeing Facebook
likes, and looking at Google Analytics.  I could reduce this with
discipline.  One reason why I’m worried about changing to LessWrong is
that I may spend a lot of time replying to comments there (it would seem
rude not to).  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Attention (Not Very Important)</strong><br />
When I’ve been blogging I’ve noticed that I’ve thought a lot about new
topics.  This attention is incredibly hard to quantify.  I expect it
isn’t too important to consider here, because these seem like good
things for me to come up with anyway.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-do-you-think">What Do You Think?</h3>
<p>Do any of you have input in the order and/or importance of these costs
and benefits?  Ideally we could eventually put together a Fermi
estimate, but some of these are really difficult to estimate.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="blog-efficiency">Blog Efficiency</h4>
<p>This post took me approximately 3.5 Pomodoros to write and publish
While writing it I started 2 other blog posts which I would like to soon
finish (one of which took another 0.5 Pomodoros). This post is around 900 words, so this results in around 250 words per Pomodoro, or 10 words per minute.) One of these new blog posts includes
details on my existing blog traffic to provide insight to some of the
above.  I would love to write a rigorous analysis of each, but it would
take quite a long time. </p>

<p>One problem that plagues the existing Effective Altruism movement is a

    <id>http://ozziegooen.com/blog/2013/09/21/navigating-the-epistemologies-of-effective-altruism</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few months ago I was with several members of the effective altruism
community on a video chat about how to compare different effective
altruism groups.  Someone recommended that we try to have a
meta-evaluation to rank them, but on some further discussion it became
apparent that that would be incredibly difficult to do.  </p>

<p>The different organizations just don’t have the same goals as
each other.  Many were “effective” within their own
standard of epistemology, but not in those of the others.  So comparing them was more about comparing general epistemologies
then doing direct comparisons of the organizations themselves.</p>

<p>Here is my current attempt at making some sense of the “main” effective altruist
groups, based on their disagreements on epistemology.  </p>

<h2 id="charity-evaluators">Charity Evaluators</h2>

<p>It makes sense to begin with <strong><a href="http://givewell.org/">Givewell</a></strong>, because they seem to be the first and most recognized group within Effective Altruism.  Upon launch in 2007 they promoted the idea that charities could be
evaluated on the efficiency of money put in to the amount of “good”
outputted.  This was backed up with research by the GiveWell team to
identify and recognize the “most efficient” charities.  This made a lot
of sense to many smart people, but soon things became quite complicated
as groups also trying to “do the most good” within charity evaluation
emerged to somewhat compete with them.</p>

<p>GiveWell is reluctant to investigate animal welfare charities, seemingly
because its founders value animals <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2010/12/27/animal-welfare-charities/">substantially less than humans</a>.  Other people have decided that animals are worth more in respect to humans than Givewell has indicated, and some of these have set up a “GiveWell for Animals”, or <strong><a href="http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org/Evaluation">Effective Animal Activism</a></strong>.  <strong>Aidgrade</strong> was established a semi-Givewell competitor and disagrees with them about the <a href="http://www.aidgrade.org/uncategorized/some-friendly-concerns-with-givewell">proper methods to do charity evaluations</a>.</p>

<h2 id="effective-altruism-funders">Effective Altruism Funders</h2>
<p>Then come the more somewhat high-risk meta-charities that promote
giving to Effective Altruist groups, like <strong>Giving What We Can</strong>, <strong>The
Life You Can Save</strong>, and <strong>80,000 Hours</strong>.  These groups are really interesting to me
because on paper what they’re doing seems to be working (Giving What We
Can has estimated to be able to encourage the giving of around <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/getting-involved/donate">$8 for
every $1 donated to them</a>, for instance).  </p>

<p>Yet from what I understand, GiveWell refuses to recommend any of these as top charities.  My
impression is that GiveWell finds it highly unlikely that any of these
organizations are as effective  as their recommended
charities.  Of course, many of these organizations exist on the
assumption that they are.  This area seems particularly awkward as all of these
meta-charities promote GiveWell publicly, leading to <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-09-08/a-conversation-with-holden-karnofsky-co-founder-of-givewell-part-ii">several</a> <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/172-interview-with-holden-karnofsky-co-founder-of-givewell">interviews</a>.  I imagine that it’s better off for everyone that Givewell and CEA appear as close friends, yet internally it seems like there’s a bit of tension over this stark disagreement on the need for CEA’s existence.  This disagreement is somewhat showcased in the comments <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/254-case-study-designing-a-new-organisation-that-might-be-more-effective-than-givewell-s-top-recommendation">here</a>.  </p>

<p>Also of note here is <strong><a href="http://www.effectivefundraising.net/">Effective Fundraising</a></strong>.  This group is directly writing grants for both the AMF (GiveWell’s top choice) and the Humane League (Effective Animal Activism’s top choice).  They’ve discussed why they split between them <a href="http://www.effectivefundraising.net/1/post/2013/08/how-we-select-our-charities.html">here</a>.  80,000 Hours and CEA have interviewed them and written a blog post with a very nice name and slightly less praising contents.  There’s a bit of back and forth between them in the <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/254-case-study-designing-the-world-s-most-effective-charity">comments</a>, which I referred to earlier.</p>

<h2 id="ai-risk-and-far-future-researchers">AI Risk and Far Future Researchers</h2>
<p>Going further, when coming to the topic of AI risk, things get much more
confusing.  Organizations like <strong><a href="http://intelligence.org/">MIRI</a></strong> and
<strong><a href="http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/">FHI</a></strong> claim that AI risk and other existential
risks are by far the most important causes.  Holden of Givewell wrote a
very long critique <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/cbs/thoughts_on_the_singularity_institute_si/">here</a>, which there’s since been quite a bit of debate about.  I suspect that incredibly few people actually have a deep understanding of the efficiencies or even importance of donating to prevent AI risk, and it is quite apparent that most donating will have to go with either a gut feeling or choose based on which social group they trust more.  </p>

<p>Brian Tomasik has been a very interesting and rather independent thinker
within the movement, known for his series of <a href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/">Utilitarian Essays</a>. Even more than animal causes, he has numbers to recommend donating for <a href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/humane-insecticides.html">insect causes</a> that make it seem like a fantastic area for efficient intervention.  The main argument I’ve heard from others against insect causes is that they seem intuitively silly, not that they aren’t actually effective.  </p>

<p>Recently Brian has made his own research institute called <strong><a href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/where-i-recommend-donating.html">FRI</a></strong> to focus on long term suffering reduction.  Sure enough it’s his number 1 recommended charity, but more surprisingly to me is that the number 2 isn’t another similar far-future venture like MIRI or FHI, but instead <a href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/where-i-recommend-donating.html">Animal Ethics</a>.  I suppose he’s both very concerned with the far future, but not very concerned with AI risk (the main reason he wouldn’t recommend MIRI or FHI).</p>

<p>Another organization that comes to my mind is <strong>Leverage Research</strong>.  I’m not sure
what category to put them in because they seem to be trying to do a bit
of everything.  However, I would point out that they appear to be the
polar opposites of GiveWell regarding to belief in transparency, with all of the
other organizations mentioned above are somewhat in between (with the
possible exception of Effective Fundraising).  My belief is that their
expected method of doing the most good involves having a few smart
people spend several years 
thinking about “big issues”, without much care for outsider input
(you’ll notice a lack of much information on their <a href="http://www.leverageresearch.org/">website</a>).  These research topics seem to be more psychological and social than
AI-risk, from what I understand.  Most other EA organizations seem very skeptical of their research posted so far,
mainly <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/el9/a_critique_of_leverage_researchs_connection_theory/">Connection Theory</a>.  However, a few people within Leverage run <a href="http://www.thehighimpactnetwork.org/">Think!</a>, and they have created the <a href="http://www.effectivealtruismsummit.com/">Effective Altruist Summit</a>, which has gotten good reviews.</p>

<h2 id="future-organizations">Future Organizations</h2>

<p>I really hope that the issue of correct epistemology gets resolved and
more of these organizations can at least agree on some standard ways of
Effective Altruist Organization evaluation.  But it seems unlikely to
happen anytime soon.</p>

<p>The current trend from my point of view seems to be that every other new
prominent Effective Altruist thinker will create a new organization to
match another unique epistemology.  I really hope that we don’t get
stuck with 20 different Charity Evaluators of slightly differing
standards and 50 funding groups that randomly give to selections from
those different evaluators, and another 10 Far Future groups that will
emphasize slightly different things because of unique epistemological
reasons.  But given the fact that there is so much disagreement within
what seems like such a small and intelligent group already, I could
definitely see things going this way.</p>

<p>Granted, this still is a lot better than what is the global cultural
norm right now.  I would expect that most of the groups above average
are far more useful than the global human average.  But the global norm
is pathetically low, so that shouldn’t be considered too important.
Within these groups, I’d expect that many consider order of magnitude
differences between them, so internal fragmentation may cause quite a bit
of damage.  And it’s definitely confusing as anything to a newcomer who
just wants to be an “Efficient Altruist”.</p>

<h3 id="personal-bias">Personal Bias</h3>
<p>I should point out that I know people from most of the organizations
mentioned, so probably am quite biased.  I am presently
working at 80,000 Hours, which is based in the same office as Giving
What we Can, The Center For Effective Altruism, and The Future of Humanity
Institute.  Recently I applied to and was rejected from
working at Leverage Research.</p>

<h3 id="blog-efficiency">Blog Efficiency</h3>
<p>This post took me about 5 hours to write. I ended up splitting my
thoughts into two posts (leaving the rest for one more to come shortly).
I’ve tracked 4 Pomodoros in this time, but then I just kept on
working for a few hours without tracking.  I originally intended for
this to be about 2 Pomodoros, but this was for a small comment about
“Epistemology as a Deus Ex Machina” rather than a small EA Org overview.  </p>

<p>My guess is that I’ll dedicate at least another hour or two to checking
stats of readership for this post and/or reading/responding to comments.</p>

    <link href="http://ozziegooen.com/blog/2013/09/20/effective-altruism-is-open-territory/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-20T21:53:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://ozziegooen.com/blog/2013/09/20/effective-altruism-is-open-territory</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Academic disciplines sometimes start with bangs.  A few initial ideas
lead to a flurry of innovation which lasts until the field is either
split off into sub disciplines (psychology, cybernetics), or becomes
mostly irrelevant.  </p>

<p>I think that Effective Altruism may be an academic discipline waiting to
emerge. It seems like there are some incredibly fundamental problems in
the field that have barely had any thought put into them.  This includes
questions like should donations happen now vs. later, or what
flow-through effects are like, or understanding if the average software
engineer creates more value writing software or donating their salary.</p>

<p>Once some headway is made, questions like these could lead to much
larger fields.  Judging on the history
of science, the discoverers will be remembered, even if many
of their insights were inevitable.  From a fame and perceived influence
perspective, Effective Altruism seems like a good field to study.  </p>

<h3 id="who-will-do-the-research">Who will do the research?</h3>

<p>The ironic thing is that most people able to research
Effective Altruism seem to be choosing against it because it itself may
not be effective to research.  Many of the most prominent EA bloggers
have other careers and only think and write on this in their spare time.  I think that researching Effective 
Altruism itself has barely been considered to be an Effective Altruist
career possibility at all within the movement, unless its directly related to the efforts of a specific organization like Givewell or 80,000 Hours.  It seems quite possible that even within this open
territory, incredibly little progress will be made any time soon.</p>

<p>Another possibility is that some non-effective altruists would study
Effective Altruism.  Perhaps counter-factually this may
a rather nice outcome, though the discipline figureheads would all be
very strange representatives.  While this could be interesting, it seems
exceedingly unlikely, as it would be expected to be difficult to
research something one doesn’t believe in.  However, given the amazing
flexibility it seems like we’ve seen in adherence to strict optimization
within the community, I’m sure there will be a few members to
compromise, even if the math doesn’t work out.</p>

<h3 id="when-will-effective-altruism-research-be-effective">When will Effective Altruism Research be Effective?</h3>
<p>The success of Effective Altruism research will very much depend on the
acceptance of Effective Altruism among people making important decisions
(either lots of people making minor decisions or a few people making
very important ones).  If this doesn’t happen, even a perfect model of
how to optimize one’s life for humanity wouldn’t have any non-academic
weight.  </p>

<p>So perhaps much research into this field is a gamble in the future
public interest in it, as there’s definitely not much now.  My guess is
that if the movement starts becoming significantly more popular,
researchers will begin flooding in realizing the sense of the
opportunity.  Of course, it may be much more difficult for the movement
to become much more popular without significant research on its side.
Right now organizations like 80,000 Hours are making recommendations,
but detractors are somewhat right when they point out that 80,000 Hours
doesn’t have much evidence or research to advice with.</p>

<p>In this system, the current default of employed people doing this in
their free time may be a good idea for now.  If we have a lot of hobbyists
figuring out the basics and promoting them, it may only be a matter of
time until the snowball rolls far enough for people to get serious about the discipline.  When they do, I suspect things will get <em>very</em> interesting.</p>

    <link href="http://ozziegooen.com/blog/2013/09/19/should-more-nonprofits-fail/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-19T18:38:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://ozziegooen.com/blog/2013/09/19/should-more-nonprofits-fail</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a> is about <em>the</em> most successful business
incubator to date.  It’s hatched 37 companies with worth or sold for
over $40 million in its’ few years of life, and has an acceptance rate
of less than 6%.  However, almost all of these companies fail.  As
<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/startup-odds-of-success-2013-5#ixzz2V5fDO1Nd">Business Insider</a> points out,<strong>“93% of the companies that get accepted by Y Combinator eventually fail”</strong>.</p>

<p>Though this is agnowledged as an unfortunate hurdle, it’s also widely
believed that quite a bit of business failure is healthy to markets.
Poor ideas and implementations get weeded out for better ones, and in
the end the winners typically are quite a bit better than average.
International capitalism is very harsh but results in quality products.</p>

<p>It would seem to me like the bar for Effective Altruist organizations is
significantly higher in many ways than for these businesses.  That is
not because it’s difficult to fundraise, but because it’s difficult to
be effective.  </p>

<p>I want to clarify on the demands of an organization that itself is
“Effective” in the “Effective Altruist” sense.  An “effective” organization 
here is one where the world is better off with it in existance than if
the counterfactual resources required were used for the “next” best
utilitarian cause.  A lower bound for this should be if all of the
organizational employees earned to give in their highest paying jobs
possible, and all of the resulting money, with that from organizational
donors, would go to the AMF instead.</p>

<p>So for example, if a 5-person division receiving $100,000 per year
 were “effective”, it would mean that it is doing
more good than if all 5 people would have instead gone to work and
donated that money (say $20,000 each per person per year), plus that
$100,000 all would have gone to save the AMF.  This is a really tough
requirement given the efficiency of the AMF, but is what some of these
groups claim.</p>

<p>Creating a charity or finding any cause more efficient than the <a href="http://www.againstmalaria.com/">Against
Malaria Foundation</a> is just incredibly difficult.  I’m quite sure that
when the AMF was starting it couldn’t have expected to reach the
efficiencies and successes that it had.  One reason for this is that
Givewell gets to cherry pick the most efficient outcomes rather than the
best plans, and it seems like these would fall on the end of the
gaussian curve of luck as well as skill.</p>

<p>This isn’t to say that it’s a poor idea to create an Effective Altruist
organization, in the same way that it’s not a particularly poor idea to
create a business knowing the poor success rates.  It may be with the
right idea you can expect a reasonable expected value, even given the
chance of failure.  </p>

<p>What it does mean is that I would expect that organizations attempting Effective Altruism <em>should be failing.</em>  I’m not sure how many, but 90% wouldn’t intuitively seem unreasonable to me given that’s the bar for what I would assume an easier goal (business success as a Y-Combinator acceptee).  </p>

<p>But looking back, have any failed?  Have any groups in this area really
admitted failure after looking at some difficult metrics?</p>

<p>Some possible groups in this area that may be “Effective Altruist” that
come to my mind are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Givewell</li>
  <li>The Future of Humanity Institute</li>
  <li>Effective Animal Altruism</li>
  <li>Effective Fundraising</li>
  <li>Aidgrade</li>
  <li>80,000 Hours</li>
  <li>Giving What We Can</li>
  <li>The Life You Can Save</li>
  <li>The Machine Intelligence Research Institute</li>
  <li>The Center for Applied Rationality</li>
  <li>Leverage Research</li>
  <li>Think! Network</li>
</ul>

<p>One alternative may be to imagine that we are in a gold rush where there
is so much unexplored area in this domain that almost each new venture
succeeds.  If this were true I would think that there should be a lot
new EA organizations until this stops being the case.</p>

<p>Another alternative explanation is that many of these groups aren’t
actually “Effective” in the “Effective Altruist” sense, and don’t care
to be.  Or that there are so many definitions of “Effective Altruist”
that each organization gets to pick their own specific one.  </p>

    <id>http://ozziegooen.com/blog/2013/09/18/my-productivity-failure-loop</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve tried structured methods (Getting Things Done, Task Management
Systems, the Kanban Method, Polyphasic Sleep, Pomodoro) several times and almost each time so far has ended
in abysmal failure.  </p>

<p>It’s surprisingly alarming because each time I seem to go through the
same exact pattern.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Read a small bit about a project management method, become intrigued.</li>
  <li>Start using it to it’s most basic extent.</li>
  <li>Enjoy the gains, but desire to become much better.</li>
  <li>Read extensively on it and try to go substantially further.</li>
  <li>Get tired of the increased structure workload and give up completely.</li>
  <li>Be satisfied with the new productivity gains from having no
structure.</li>
  <li>Feel too incompetent to attempt other management tools in the near
future.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is a terrible failure mode and I’m trying my best to not keep on
this cycle of spaced mediocrity.  </p>

<h3 id="possible-solutions">Possible Solutions</h3>
<p>The only ways out of this that I can tell are:  </p>

<ol>
  <li>Maintain one basic state of management for an extended period (30
days) before reaching any further.  </li>
  <li>Forcing myself to retreat to a previous position rather than give up
completely, post wear-out.</li>
</ol>

<p>Right now I’ve chosen option 2, because option 1 seems far too slow.  </p>

<h3 id="existing-dilemma">Existing Dilemma</h3>
<p>Last week I’ve started working on Pomodoros and sure enough, my system
quickly got out of hand.  I started with an online tracker, then
extended that to a printed page, then extended that to two printed pages
(one to manage tasks and the other to manage time), and then stopped
completely over the weekend.  </p>

<p>Now I’m trying again, but with just one page and the time tracker app.
I’ll pre-commit here for more public pressure, and let people know once
I hit 30 days.  </p>

    <id>http://ozziegooen.com/blog/2013/09/18/existing-pomodoro-structure</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I’ve been getting back into the <a href="http://Pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro Technique</a>.  It was fun at first, then got to be to much, then I stopped, now I’m trying to continue at a basic level.</p>

<p>I started with <a href="http://mac.appstorm.net/reviews/productivity-review/tomatoes-full-featured-Pomodoro-time-managing-app/">Tomatoes</a>, a mac application that was highly recommended and seemed to do the most important Pomodoro necessities.  </p>

<p>I quickly found that I wanted to write notes on my actions, and the
application didn’t have any simple way of doing this.  I also wanted to
see if I could add other useful info, so I designed a Pomodoro sheet and
started using it.</p>

<p>While I’m all for web applications, paper is often far more flexible.  I
could imagine that there is the potential for web applications to truly
be flexible.  This is not yet the case, and not even being able to add
simple fields (notes, emotional level, etc.) to Pomodoros makes me feel
like existing tools are quite inadequate.  Perhaps I’ll eventually
attempt my own software solution, but for now I wanted to experiment
with what works for me on paper.</p>

<div style="max-width:50%">
  <p><img src="http://ozziegooen.com/assets/posts/pomodoro-itemsheet.jpg" alt="Pomodoro Rule Sheet" /></p>
</div>

<p>A day later after creating the first page, I realized that this sheet still didn’t give a good
breakdown on what I was doing throughout the day.  Sadly the App doesn’t
provide information into this either.  </p>

<p>To compensate I made another page for myself to scribble notes on about
my workload.  The segments that are shaded are the ones where I did
actual Pomodoros. I have used big numbers (low ones between 1-7) to
indicate which specific Pomodoro activities I was working on (labeled by
number on the first sheet).</p>

<p>This particularly felt frustrating because I do have lots of information
online with time stamps.  This includes git commits, documents, and my
work log on Hipchat.  Unfortunately I haven’t found any way of combining
this data to understand how I spend my time.  This is some of what I am
hoping to eventually achieve with <a href="http://feedhaven.com/">Feedhaven</a>,
assuming no one else makes something satisfactory first.</p>

<div style="max-width:50%">
  <p><img src="http://ozziegooen.com/assets/posts/pomodoro-timesheet.jpg" alt="Pomodoro Time Sheet" /></p>
</div>

<p>The idea was to have both of these sheets side by side. One big issue with this was that my desk isn’t really big enough to hold
on to the folder.  This, given the fact that I was using a small binder
which was clearly not designed for looking at both sides of a page, made
it very difficult to actually use this system in a practical sense.  It
feels strange in retrospect, but my work flow was limited by the length
of my working desk.</p>

<p>I did this for two days, then found that I lacked all will to continue
with the entire system during the weekend.  </p>

<p><img src="http://ozziegooen.com/assets/posts/desk-setup.jpg" alt="Office Setup" /></p>

<p>Below is a summary of an approximation of the Pomodoros I have done each
day.  Note that over the last weekend (the 16th and 17th) it fell off
almost completely as I got really frustrated with the method.  Now I
will continue to use this mediocre software system, and will slowly wait
until I feel ready to go back into a more rigorous paper-software
combination again.  </p>

<p><img src="http://ozziegooen.com/assets/posts/pomodoro-timeline.png" alt="Tomatoes Pomodoro App Worklog" /></p>

<p>Now I’ve temporarily put the paper system on hold, but am still doing
the application one.  I’ll definitely re-attempt the paper version soon,
but the most important thing for now is to at least keep on the Pomodoro
system in general.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Post-Decision Arguments</strong><br />
Definition: Arguments ideated after a decision has been reached.<br />
Similar to: Rationalizations, Justificatations <br />
<strong>Shadow Zone</strong><br />
Definition: The space of all post-decision arguments for a decision.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A: “Would you like to come to a tech talk in a few minutes?”<br />
B: “No, I still have to eat dinner.”<br />
A: “There will be food at the talk.”<br />
B: “Yes, but I need to finish up some work tonight.”<br />
A: “It’s near by and you could just check it out.”<br />
B: “I think it will rain soon and don’t want to get wet.”<br />
A: “I’ve checked the report and actually the clouds are just passing by”.<br />
B: “Maybe so, but it’s been shown statistically that networking events lead to lower happiness levels”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m quite familiar with conversations like the one above.  While most aren’t as long as this, it should be quite apparent that none of the reasons mentioned is the real decision factor.  More argument would lead to more rationalizations, but when discussed in this way it would appear that the primary (and quite possibly the only) reason for not attending the event is hidden from the receiver.  </p>

<p>This could be either an explicit lie, or an internal rationalization.  Either way can be very frustrating, but I belive the second is far more common and dangerous.</p>

<p>I believe it’s been shown in studies (very sorry for not linking to one, I can’t seem to find it at the moment) that when people make opinions and decisions, they often make intutive judgements immiately and follow them up with long lists of logical reasons to back that up.  This means that the reasons given aren’t exactly why the person believes that at all.  And thus, if one were to make fantastic arguments against each, the belief wouldn’t necessarilly change. </p>

<p>I’ll refer to these “unimportant” arguments as <strong>post-decision arguments</strong>, to help point out that they get made after a decision has already been reached, and thus have had no role in the decision making process.  Thus, any work countering a post-decision argument is only useful insofar as to get someone to admit a pre-decision argument, which often will never happen.</p>

<p>The scary thing is that these people have no idea that this is happening.  We <em>think</em> we make decisions based on explicit reasons, but normally don’t do so at all.  Instead we make up these strange arguments to support our instant thought processes.  And then spend dozens of hours of debate on points that aren’t even decision-relevant in the first place.</p>

<p>This would be particularly terrible if our intuitive process worked poorly.  And sometimes it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias">does</a>, but normally it’s able to get us through the day surprisingly well.    </p>

<p>The best thing we can do is to recognize these areas and agnowledge them.  For whatever reason, “rationalization” seems to be a very touchy and misunderstood word for this sort of thing.  So rather than use “rationalization” as a word for a single argument, I prefer the term “<em>shadow zone</em>” as the space of all arguments made post-decision.  So instead of thinking “Is that argument a rationalization or a realistic reason?” we could ask “are we in the <em>shadow zone</em>?”</p>

<p>The <em>shadow zone</em> is named as to imply a space that no one really understands and that everyone finds quite murkey and mysterious.  Which is exactly what many of these post-decision arguments are.  The fact that they weren’t used to make a decision implies that they haven’t been thought out but instead were chosen to <em>feel</em> satisfactory.  Ideally these arguments would come with big <strong>warning!</strong> signs attached, but until the Google Glass gets that functionality we’ll have to do with clever names.  </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You know all of those people hanging around during a discussion while 1-3 people debate something? I think they’re likely a sign that something is wrong. Let’s look at the benefits and costs of having non-speaking entities in a meeting or discussion. </p>

<h2 id="possible-benefits">Possible Benefits:</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Learning from watching</strong><br />
 This may be improved with a video.  Unlike human discussions, videos can be sped up, skipped, and played whenever convenient.  I also suspect that there is a high correlation between participation and understanding, so I assume that many people not participating are not understanding much anyway.</li>
  <li><strong>Possibilities of comments</strong><br />
 How useful have these spare comments actually been in the past, specifically those that can’t be emailed to a specific party?  Online chat systems can target questions and comments far more efficiently than meeting situations can.</li>
  <li><strong>Support for the speakers</strong><br />
 If speakers just want to feel appreciated, then purchase inexpensive virtual assistants to attend in the place of useful employees.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="possible-harms-besides-obvious-opportunity-costs">Possible Harms (besides obvious opportunity costs):</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Reduction of energy</strong><br />
 When I’m bored I loose energy and wind up more exhausted than I would have been accomplishing useful work.  Paying half-attention and doing nothing actively reduces the quality of my life.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Culture of meetings and slow time encouraged</strong>  </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>That is all.  I encourage small meetings, and when discussions begin with a subset, either they agree to talk separately or it’s ok-ed for the others to leave.</p>

<p>So if you have a meeting of 10 people whose time is worth $300 per hour (not salary but value), then by taking 5 minutes to set up, you are wasting $250.00 ($50.00 * 5).  A wasted 1-hour meeting of that size could have <a href="http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF">saved a kid from malaria</a>. There are quite a few other articles on this subject.  They seem to focus on business meetings and making sure they go well.  One detail that they use that may not apply far outside is a reliance on using employee salary as a proxy for the cost of an employee’s time.  This seems like a poor metric where there is much producer surplus, as employee replaceability is not trivial and employee value is much higher than the salary (if it’s lower, they should be fired).  The fact that business articles seem to use this measure indicates that they don’t often attempt to calculate an employee’s value per hour, which seems like a larger error than not quantifying meetings. For nonprofits and small organizations this can be especially true.  For a nonprofit to be effective (in the effective altruist term), individual hourly value must be at least as much as a company salary for that person.  Else the individual could just work at a company and donate that amount to the nonprofit.  So either the hourly value is quite high, or the nonprofit is ineffective.  Startups are paid with equity with terms not incredibly correlated to their working hours, so would also have to adjust their hourly rate in a way that makes sense to the company.</p>

<p>As a bit of a dramatic action, one can imagine destroying X money every minute during a meeting, to remind people how urgent it is and make sure they don’t waste time.  Deciding the optimal amount of X is an interesting thought experiment. Imagine that a meeting is costing $500 per hour.  If destroying half of that in physical items would lead to a shortening of the meeting by 1/2, then it would be net neutral. Meeting Cost = Time + Money Destroyed = (cost/min) * (60 - f(d)) + d Here cost/min refers to the cost of the meeting per minute as shown in the article above.  60 refers to 60 minutes, assuming a 1 hour meeting.  f(d) is a function based on d from which the time would be reduced by, and d is the money destroyed. While I won’t attempt to model this, I would imagine that destroying somewhere between 1/3rd to 1/10th of the money wasted could be an efficient use of your money.  So for example, at the next meeting one has with 20 high profile people in the audience, you may want one person in a very visible place burn or rip up about $10-$30 each minute, to remind people to keep it short and important.  Or you may want to dramatically destroy an object worth as much if it makes the point better.</p>

<h2 id="lectures--presentations">Lectures &amp; Presentations</h2>

<p><img src="http://ozziegooen.com/assets/posts/lecture.png" alt="lecture-hall" /><br />
If we value our student’s time at $40 per hour, then a 1-hour lecture with 200 students costs $8,000 of student’s time.  You could destroy a 50-inch TV or 1/4th that cost (maybe do it pieces throughout?)  At what point in the teacher’s preparation would the marginal benefit of them preparing more actually be less than that of the student’s time?  It would obviously be somewhere, but probably quite late, especially if material would be re-used later. This is one thing that makes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MOOCs</a> so awesome.  With even a small optimization on traditional lecturers, the totaled value may be gigantic.  Lectures are something that deserve large optimization because they are incredibly expensive, the only issue is that the expenses aren’t obviously apparent nor are incurred on the parties responsible for them. Likewise, large public presentations should be optimized for similar reasons.  Not for the benefit of the presenter, but rather out of respect for the size of the audience.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Because most Silicon Valley parties are stale and repetitive.</p>

<h2 id="the-nsa-party">The NSA Party!</h2>
<p>By far the most secure party on this list.  Nothing will be stolen from anyone at this party, because all attendees and conversations will be recorded (on video and audio), and fully transcribed.  This information may or may not be “hacked”, making it available for everyone with an internet connection, several days post party completion.</p>

<h2 id="the-anonymous-party">The Anonymous Party</h2>
<p>Everyone wears guy fawkes masks, making everyone anonymous and unrecognizable. The event will begin with a political campaign to extradite Bradley Manning, but people will likely get bored quickly, turning the event instead into a prank calling exposition.  Illegal activity will be encouraged.  Then the police will arrive and it may or may not be discovered that the party organizers were actually FBI informants.  Sign up would be done publicly on Facebook, for convenience.</p>

<h2 id="the-philanthropist-party">The Philanthropist Party</h2>
<p>Here we publicly pledge to give away most of our money to charity, on the one condition that we become billionaires first.  </p>

<h2 id="the-silicon-valley-job-creation-party">The Silicon Valley Job Creation Party</h2>
<p>At this party, we’ll hire a well payed programmer to make a machine to serve us drinks.  A minority of the profits from ticket sales will altruistically go to an immigration bill targeting Indian programmers with hydraulics experience.</p>

<h2 id="the-fox-news-party">The Fox News Party</h2>
<p>This will actually just be a fun party, just to throw people off.</p>

<h2 id="the-party-venture-to-save-the-world">The Party Venture to Save the World!</h2>
<p>The party managers create a brand new type of charity event that is incredibly effective.  The party becomes a surprising success, and within only 2 hours, sees the pledges of tens of thousands of dollars to Greenpeace. At a randomized time, a public company “purchases” the venture for branding purposes and the party abruptly ends, offering everyone 36 seconds to exit. </p>

<h2 id="the-social-entrepreneur-party">The Social Entrepreneur Party</h2>
<p>At this party no one is permitted to talk about social ventures, but instead to discuss how important it is to have parties that promote social ventures.</p>

<h2 id="the-1-party">The 1% Party</h2>
<p>This is pretty much already a typical Bay Area party.</p>

<h2 id="the-99-party">The 99% Party</h2>
<p>Essentially the same group of people from the 1% party, but here complaining about not being invited to the the 0.01% party (which is much fancier).</p>

<h2 id="the-instagram-party">The Instagram Party</h2>
<p>Picture taking is encouraged, especially through cell phones.  Attendees win prizes like “most popular” in online badge form.  Managers get all photos taken at the event, and proceed to sell them all on iStockPhoto to help pay for the party.  </p>

<h2 id="the-dress-like-an-anti-internet-bill-party">The “Dress Like an Anti-Internet Bill Party”</h2>
<p>No description needed, use your imagination a bit.</p>

<h2 id="the-global-warming-party">The Global Warming Party</h2>
<p>The party takes place in a huge hall with blocks of ice instead of chairs and tables.  Heat will be on full, so the party will transition into a pool party, then a hot tub party.  During this time we’ll discuss the importance of issues like bank corruption and SOPA.  </p>

  <p>This was originally my final research paper for The Economics of Technology and Growth class at Claremont Mckenna College.

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>There is widespread acknowledgement between economists and psychologists that humans use time discounting when making decisions. (Shane Frederick, 2002) (Gal Zauberman, 2009)  This research examines net-negative choices that humans may willingly make because of this discounting.  First a “devil curve” model is described which studies the maximum possible utility loss a human may experience with very specific new choices.  The discount loss is calculated under different conditions of period number and discount factor.  The possibility and extent of trade between individuals with different time discount functions is studied.  Finally the implications of this are used to observe the impact of time discounting on the benefits of technology and choice in a mathematical simulation.  It is found that time discounting has the potential to cause great disutility, and may already doing so.  </p>

<h2 id="a-short-fable">A Short Fable</h2>
<p>You’re walking through the woods and a devil appears.  Before you can run, he claims that there’s not enough freedom in society.  Humanity needs more choices, more ideas, more technologies.  You’re suspicious, but he swears that he won’t lie or deceive you.  The Devil promises you an infinite number of choices.  He will tell you exactly how much good each will do you throughout your life. You trust the devil enough to be honest and decide you might as well listen to him.  You’ve had a strong belief in freedom and choice and trust yourself to be logical. After all, how bad could this possibly be?  </p>

<h2 id="the-first-choice">The First Choice</h2>
<p>He offers you a large delicious juicy red apple.  He tells you that eating it will give you a small headache, but not for 20 years.  You are quite hungry.  The headache will result in about two times as much pain as this apple will bring you joy now.  It’s your choice.  Will you accept it?<br />
<a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/apple.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/apple.png" alt="Figure 2: Juicy Red Apple (Tembhekar)" /> </a>  </p>

<p><strong>Probably.</strong>  The most optimistic estimates on human discount rates estimate it at around 5.6%.  Using hyperbolic discounting this would mean that a typical human discounts utility from 20 years in the future by approximately 53%. (Steffen Andersen, 2011)  Therefor the victim in this case would value the headache at approximately (1-0.53)*2 = 0.94 times the enjoyment of the apple now.  This person would accept the deal with the devil.  </p>

<h2 id="the-utility-and-discount-curves">The Utility and Discount Curves</h2>
<p>Let’s consider how much damage these deals can do.  First we assume hyperbolic discounting of utility with time.  Often economists use exponential discounting for convenience, but hyperbolic discounting has been shown to be a more accurate model for predicting human behavior. (Steffen Andersen, 2011)   </p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/3-larger.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/3-larger.png?w=922" alt="Hyperbolic vs. Exponential Discount Factors (Moxfyre)" /> </a> </p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/hyperbolic-exponential-discount-functions.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/hyperbolic-exponential-discount-functions.png" alt="hyperbolic-exponential-discount-functions" /> </a></p>

<p>The graph and equations above show the differences between hyperbolic and exponential curves.  In general a hyperbolic curve has a longer “tail” then its exponential equivalent.  Most of the results in this paper are only shown for hyperbolic discount functions. Humans on average lost significantly more utility when exponential functions were tried, although this was in part because hyperbolic and exponential curves with the same discount factors were compared to each other, as opposed to choosing ones with similar integrals instead. To model the deal with the devil, we assume that the human is expecting to live 50 years with constant utility for that time.  This constant utility is standardized to 1.  We assume a discount factor of 0.1, or 10%.  This is higher than the most optimistic estimates, but less than many others. The following curves represent utility and the “discount coefficient” (The amount that utility in a given period is discounted due to the discount factor).  </p>

<h2 id="uniform-distributionhttpbowlabsfileswordpresscom201305uniform-distributionpngw922-httpbowlabsfileswordpresscom201305uniform-distributionpng"><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/uniform-distribution.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/uniform-distribution.png?w=922" alt="uniform-distribution" /> </a></h2>

<h2 id="mathematical-theory-of-devil-choices">Mathematical Theory of Devil Choices</h2>
<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/4-art-of-the-deal.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/4-art-of-the-deal.png" alt="Art of a Deal with the Devil (Pacher)" /> </a><br />
The individual can be modeled to have a decision function, D, which is used to decide whether or not to accept choices.  “Greedy choices” are ones in which a person would sacrifice utility from the future in order to gain utility in the present.  In these cases, the “decision equation” can be used to tell when the person will make a choice.</p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/delta-d.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/delta-d.png" alt="delta-d" /> </a></p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/term-definitions.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/term-definitions.png" alt="term-definitions" /> </a></p>

<p>When ΔD &gt; 0, the choice will be made. In this case we are studying “devil choices”, which are “greedy choices” with maximum possible harm to the participant.  To achieve this, a decision is given in which just enough utility is given in the present to get the participant to agree to give up an amount of utility in the future.  This can be assumed to be a negligible amount, and thus ΔD ~ 0 and we find the following relationship.</p>

<p>   <a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/utility-equation-1.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/utility-equation-1.png" alt="utility-equation-1" /> </a></p>

<p>The second important equation is the net utility calculation, which determines the net utility difference after a choice is made.  ΔU is the change in utility.</p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/utility-equation-2.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/utility-equation-2.png?w=300" alt="utility-equation-2" /> </a></p>

<p>Combining these two equations, we find the following</p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/utility-equation-3-repeat.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/utility-equation-3-repeat.png?w=300" alt="utility-equation-3-repeat" /> </a></p>

<p>Finally, we set Uf to 1 (as previously assumed), and dp to 1 (which is always true).  Thus, we find the following relationship between utility loss and discount coefficient for each period.</p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/utility-equation-4.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/utility-equation-4.png?w=300" alt="utility-equation-4" /> </a></p>

<h2 id="the-devil-curve">The Devil Curve</h2>
<p>This utility loss of devil choices can be shown graphically, as shown below.  Conveniently, the utility loss for each period can be thought of as the distance between the discount coefficient and the original expected utility at that period.</p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/devil-curve.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/devil-curve.png?w=922" alt="Maximum Discount Loss for One Period" /> </a></p>

<p>The sum of losses for all periods (“The Region of Discount Loss”) can be represented in the region between the utility curve and the discount curve, as shown below.  In the condition of Devil Choices, the line separating both regions is considered to be the “Devil Curve”.</p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/devil-curve-clean.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/devil-curve-clean.png?w=922" alt="Devil Curve" /> </a></p>

<p>In this case, with D = 0.1 and t = 50, the region of discount loss was calculated to be 63%.  This means that the devil would able to steal 63% of the victim’s utility just by giving him specific choices that he accepted.  Given these reasonable parameters, and lots of specific freedoms, the otherwise rational victim will ruin most of his life.  </p>

<h2 id="it-gets-worse">It Gets Worse</h2>
<p>This previous model had a simplifying assumption that is very convenient to the human.  It was assumed that the human could only trade away positive utility.  The utility graph had a bottom at 0 utils.  This may well not be the case, if the human can experience pain and torture without the ability for suicide. Below are models that show how utility floors of negative 1 and negative 2 would change the result of the encounter.  The Devil curve is scaled to visually represent for the greater possible trade region, with the calculations done accordingly.  This does not mean the time discounting curve itself changes, just that it applies a similar proportional impact on the available tradable utility.</p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/deeper-devil-curves.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/deeper-devil-curves.png?w=922" alt="deeper-devil-curves" /> </a></p>

<p>Thus, if a human is capable of experiencing twice as much pain as they were expecting to experience pleasure throughout their average life, then he or she would give up 190% of their entire lifetime utility to the devil.  On average, their life will now be full of misery and suffering.  Of course, if the person could possibly feel more pain, it would be even worse.    This situation wouldn’t be much better if the human were to have a smaller discount factor, as will be shown in Figure 6.  For any non-zero discount factor, a very large discount loss is possible.<br />
<a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/hell1.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/hell1.png?w=857" alt="Some Possible Results of Freedom (Angelico)" /> </a></p>

<h2 id="parameter-variation-in-the-devil-curve">Parameter Variation in the Devil Curve</h2>
<p>The devil curves with 0 floor utility were generated for all combinations of three values of period number and discount factors.  Period numbers of 5, 30, and 100 were used because they span a wide range of typical remaining human lifespans.  A very old person may only expect to live a few more years, and thus would only make decisions for utility in that time.  These period numbers can also be seen as the possible time that one can influence with current choices. The discount factors of 0.05, 0.1, and 0.3 provide a good range for what economists and psychologists typically assume it really is.   These factors can be thought of as representing people with different abilities of self-control, from a priest to a reckless daredevil.  It is possible that these numbers may even change with the mood of individuals. Of course, these factors can also represent countries or organizations.  A government in power for a limited amount of time may only be interested in that time of power.  Fortune-500 companies have lifetimes of between 40-50 years. (Bloomberg Businessweek, 2008)  Governments may have different discount factors based on how frustrated their constituents are.  Businesses may have different discount factors in accordance to how much they focus on monthly reports and short-term profits.  </p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/devil-curve-parameters.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/devil-curve-parameters.png?w=922" alt="Devil Curves for Variations in t (period numbers) and D (discount factor)" /> </a> Devil Curves for Variations in t (period numbers) and D (discount factor)[/caption] Figure 6: Devil Curves for Variations in t (period numbers) and D (discount factor) These results generally conform to what is expected.  As the period number increases, the discount loss increases, as the individual has more time periods to sacrifice.  As the discount factor increases, the individual is prone to trading future utility more. The specific numbers themselves are quite interesting.  There is significantly more variation in discount loss between the period numbers then between the discount values studied.  Even “saints” with very low discount values are still susceptible to great harm by this devil.  While it’s definitely not much of a factor for old people (the riskiest of whom have discount losses of up to 32%), this definitely seems significant for everyone else.</p>

<h2 id="the-devil-inside">The Devil Inside</h2>
<p>Fortunately appearances by the Devil don’t seem to be very common these days.  However, the Devil Curve model showed us how bad the choices available to us could be. Here we consider two ways that net-harmful decisions could still be made.  The first is by trading “Discount Utility”, and the second is by chance when common choices and technologies.</p>

<h2 id="discount-utility-and-trade">Discount Utility and Trade</h2>
<p>In the previous model, the devil was assumed to know the human’s decision curve precisely, and make decisions accordingly.    In essence, the “trade surplus” was completely delivered to the supplier, the devil.  When humans trade with each other the recipient of the trade surplus is not as clear, but the extent of trade should be similar to the devil deal. Consider two individuals with different discount curves.  One has a discount factor of 0.1, the other has a discount factor of 0.2.  In this case one unit of utility in year 20 is worth approximately 0.33 in year 1 the first individual, but would be worth approximately 0.2 for the second.</p>

<p>We can see that the different time discounting factors are essentially comparative advantages for both people, but in willingness to make certain decisions instead of production capabilities.   In this case, persons 1 and 2 will accept trades of between 0.2 and 0.3 present utils from person 1 to person 2 in exchange for 1 future util.  The net utility caused by both possible trades is shown below.</p>

<p>This total “decision surplus” can be represented in graphical form, similar to the previous curves.  The entire discount loss region of the individual with the higher discount curve should always be exchanged from the low-discount rate individual to the high-discount rate individual.  The only region in question is the area between both individuals’ discount curves.</p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/utilitarian-trade.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/utilitarian-trade.png?w=922" alt="utilitarian-trade" /> </a></p>

<p>As this graph makes apparent, for individuals with similar discount curves, this small region isn’t even that important.  It is simply the negotiation room.  On the whole, a large discount loss region will be exchanged between them, causing an incredibly large shift in utility. This is an incredibly disturbing finding because it implies that individuals with even very small differences in their discount curves would lead to massive utility imbalances.  Perhaps fortunately, these kinds of trades mostly aren’t possible yet. One implication of this is that organizations with relatively low discount factors will seek out groups with high discount factors who are willing to trade, and greatly damage them by making very large exchanges.  For example, credit companies finding at-risk individuals, and banks lending to political organizations in unstable countries.   These trades are often limited by a difficulty in holding long-term contracts.  For example, the ability to declare bankruptcy or to have a limited liability company could make it very difficult for “predatory” companies to collect on future profits, limiting their trading potential with susceptible individuals and thus protecting these individuals.  This may be one of the few cases where weak contracts may be beneficial to a society: here they ultimately protect people and organizations from themselves. This may also hint at the presence of an informal “market of discount utility”.  For example, careers requiring different discount factors will be compensated accordingly.  Careers that require little, or enjoyable, training, will be compensated less than those that require lots of upfront sacrifice, even if both groups of careers are equivalent in total net utility without the compensation.  Similar possibilities exist for infrastructure and technology improvements on the behalf of countries and companies in settings of potential trade.</p>

<h2 id="technology-and-the-utility-vs-decision-matrix">Technology and the Utility vs. Decision Matrix</h2>
<p>Here we consider the impacts of time discounting on the net utility provided by technology.  In essence technology can be modeled as the presence of choice.  The conception of a technology itself does nothing unless individuals choose to purchase and use it.  Thus new technologies can be modeled in similar ways as choices in the devil model. We assume that technologies do not naturally have any moral or time bias.  People are always coming up with new ideas, each of which can be represented as a choice with varying utility contribution over a given time set.  To attempt to imagine all possible technology utility curves, we simulate each new technology as a random utility function over time.  Each point on this curve (or noisy line) has an equal probability of being anywhere between 1 and -1, representing the addition or removal of utility. To decide whether or not to accept a technology, a person will multiply their time discount curve by the technology’s utility curve, resulting in the “decision function”.  The sum, or integral, of this function is called the “decision factor”.  If this were positive the individual would be willing to accept the technology, if it is negative he or she wouldn’t be.<br />

<p>We also study the “total utility”, which is the integral of the lifetime utility of a given technology.  When this is positive the technology will be net-beneficial in utility, and when it is negative the technology will be net-harmful. In this case we are primarily interested in impacts of “bad choices taken”, which are those with positive decision factors but negative total utility.  These are the choices we take because of our time discounting bias, but which will ultimately harm us. In regards to total utility and decision factors, four main categories emerge, one being the “bad choices taken”.  These can be put in matrix form as shown below.  The placement of each category matches its quadrant in the following simulation plot.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td> </td>
      <td>Negative Decision Factor</td>
      <td>Positive Decision Factor</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Positive Total Utility</td>
      <td>Good Choices Not Taken</td>
      <td>Good Choices Taken</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Negative Total Utility</td>
      <td>Bad Choices Not Taken</td>
      <td>Bad Choices Taken</td>
    </tr>

<p>Using Matlab, several thousand “technologies” were simulated.  The decision factors and total utility of can be plotted on a scatterplot.  White lines are placed to highlight the x and y axis, dividing the plot into 4 quadrants.  This plot is called a “Utility Vs. Decision Matrix”.  First, we show what this plot looks like for a simulation using a period size of 50 and a discounting factor of 0.1.</p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/utility-vs-decision.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/utility-vs-decision.png?w=922" alt="utility-vs-decision" /> </a></p>

<p>As shown, the technologies generally span from the bottom left to the top right.  This makes sense, as the utility curves were generated with no correlation between present and future utilities.  People take technologies primarily based on what’s good in the short term, and there’s no negative correlation between this region and the left utility region, so on average these decisions result in positive utility. The “decision average” is the mean total utility of all taken choices, which are all those on the right of the y-axis.  This is shown as a red line in quadrant 1.  The “optimal average” is the mean total utility of all taken choices without the “bad choices”, which are those in the upper right quadrant. This is shown is the red line in quadrant 1. The discount loss is the percentage difference between the optimal and decision averages, representing the average utility lost per choice due to the presence of the bad choices.  The percentage of all choices taken (on the right half) that are bad (on the bottom right quadrant) is also shown, as “bad choices taken”.  This number represents the percentage of choices that an individual will take that will be net-harmful. The results of this simulation tell us a few things.  There are more “good choices” then bad ones, with bad choices making up 16% of the total choices taken.  On average these reduce our benefits from technology by 22%, which is quite significant.  If this model were true it would mean that approximately one of every six choices you make will your life worse.<br />

<h2 id="parameter-variation-in-utility-vs-decision-simulations">Parameter Variation in Utility Vs. Decision Simulations</h2>
<p>Utility vs. decision simulations were done with all combinations of discount factors of 5%, 10%, and 30%, and period size of 5, 30, and 100.  The results are shown in the graphs below.<br />

<p>There general patterns of these simulations correspond which is what is expected.  In general, the U vs. D plot is more linear and less scattered the less the discount rate and the less the period size.  This makes sense: without either, there would be no “bad choices” and thus no points would fall in the fourth quadrant. These results are similar to what we would have expected from the results of the devil models. The numbers don’t vary as much as may have been suspected.  It seems that as a rule of thumb, people may assume that at least 10% - 20% of technologies are harmful to themselves, and should make decisions accordingly.  </p>

<h2 id="room-for-improvement">Room for Improvement</h2>
<p>There are several possible factors that are not in this model, but would suggest a more harmful or beneficial view of choices if they could be incorporated.  </p>

<h3 id="harmful-factors">Harmful Factors</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Other Biases</strong> <br />
 Time discounting is only one of the many biases humans have.  The impacts of our biases of non-rational risk taking are not considered.  Neither are the cognitive biases, or even false popular beliefs.  </li>
  <li><strong>Marketing</strong>  <br />
 This model assumed perfect information about the results of technological choices.  This is very rarely the case, as marketers often misrepresent their products.  It is unclear if “bad choices” will be misrepresented disproportionately, but it seems to.  </li>
  <li><strong>Externalities</strong><br />
 What about choices that when taken, help or harm other people?  People seem to prefer their own utility to that of others.  This has poor implications for the devil curve, but the implications in regards to technology would depend on the power people have over each other.  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="useful-factors">Useful Factors</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Group Regulation</strong><br />
 The government occasionally bans or taxes items that are considered harmful for individuals, such as cigarettes and heroin.  Social groups often provide cultural influence to bias people away from actually generally seen as short sighted (for example, adultery).  </li>
  <li><strong>Diminishing Marginal Returns</strong><br />
             In this model people trade utility, but this is never really the case in real life.  Instead technologies provide emotions and material benefits, which are bound with diminishing marginal returns, possibly restricting individuals from taking many of specific harmful actions (eating cookies, for example).</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>This paper presents a rather stark analysis of humanity’s ability to deal with choice.  The devil curves show potential utility losses of up to 88% given reasonable parameters.  The inquiry on utility trade brings up the possibility that given better trading tools, incredibly large utility shifts may occur between otherwise logical individuals.  Finally the Utility vs. Decision simulations reveal that due to time discounting, approximately 15% of our existing technologies could be net-harmful to us.  This demonstrates that time discounting may be incredibly damaging to modern society.   It is recommended that further analysis is done to understand ways to counter this force.</p>
