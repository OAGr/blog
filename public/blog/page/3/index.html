        Why Not the 3-Hour Work Week?

From The Four Hour Workweek:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“He took 6 prospective titles that everyone could live with: including ‘Broadband and White Sand’, ‘Millionaire Chameleon’ and ‘The 4-Hour Workweek’ and developed an Google Adwords campaign for each. He bid on keywords related to the book’s content including ‘401k’ and ‘language learning’: when those keywords formed part of someone’s search on Google the prospective title popped up as a headline and the advertisement text would be the subtitle. Ferriss was interested to see which of the sponsored links would be clicked on most, knowing that he needed his title to compete with over 200,000 books published in the US each year. At the end of the week, for less than $200 he knew that “The 4-Hour Workweek” had the best click-through rate by far and he went with that title.”
This was clever, but what I find most interesting is that his testing ended after one iteration.  Once he noticed that “The 4-Hour Workweek” did well, he could have tested each possible small variation.  Imagine “The 5-Hour Workweek” and “The Four Hour Workweek”.  In addition he may have realized that “The 4-Hour Workweek” sounded much more direct than the other two names, and tested other names inspired by that knowledge.  For example, “No Work on Weekdays” or “Finishing Work Before Finishing Coffee”. My suspicion is that he stopped because using Google Adwords sucks.  It’s not made for testing: it can be expensive and  <a href="http://www.pitstopmedia.com/sem/the-end-of-adwords-ab-testing-as-we-know-it">annoyingly difficult</a>.   Google Adwords was made for sending out ads in large batches, not for doing relatively minor work.  Also, Ferris’s experiment with book covers was cute, but doesn’t sound very scalable.  With proper testing it makes sense that he could have tried out hundreds of different and modified book covers to much greater success. Rahul (cofounder) and I have spent a lot of time looking into this issue of simple copy testing.  We even created our  <a href="http://www.wenameyou.com/">own website</a> t0 test text, and tried advertising it to little success (don’t try it now, the site is not currently functional).  One option we’ve grown fond of for general use is  <a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome" title="Mechanical Turk">Mechanical Turk</a>.  It’s frustrating (though less so than Google Adwords) but they have recently made it a bit better with a  <a href="https://requester.mturk.com/tour/sentiment" title="Sentiment Analysis">sentiment analysis</a> package.   <a href="https://www.pickfu.com/">Pickfu</a> is another option but is significantly more expensive.  However, even Pickfu is cheaper and easier than Google Adwords. I believe that we’re just beginning to see the beginning of serious testing software for people who aren’t website designers or advertisers.  We just need people to start accepting them and for the technologies to be made more accessible to the public.</p>

        Case Study: Using Sentiment Analysis for Better Copy
      </a>
    </h2>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>For Raise, we decided to test out Mechanical Turk’s new Sentiment Analysis program to help us come up with a great tagline.  This sends out different text or image files to anonymous users online to rate according to a set standard.  While Mechanical Turk already provided the ability to create standard HITs (standard Mechanical Turk tasks), the Sentiment Analysis program makes the process of getting this one kind of feedback much more straightforward. From Mechanical Turk:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p> ”Whether you want to track sentiment of tweets for a new product release or monitor sentiment of posts in a customers forum, Mechanical Turk makes it easy to assess sentiment quickly so you can make informed decisions.”
[caption id=”attachment_70” align=”alignnone” width=”560”] <a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-08-at-11-51-28-pm.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-08-at-11-51-28-pm.png?w=800" alt="Sentiment Analysis on Mechanical Turk" /> </a> Sentiment Analysis on Mechanical Turk[/caption] The interface is relatively simple.  You pick  an item (a slogan, for example), a question (“rate how much you like this slogan”), and then upload a .csv file with a list of all the possible slogans you want to test out.  You can choose anywhere between 10-20 ratings for each, which we’ve found to give a pretty consistant response. We tried out this technique with several slogan ideas we were considering.  But before I show you the response, try guessing the order that people preferred the following list:
- “Eyes Save Lives”
- “Charity Done Right”
- “Donate Without Paying”
- “We Give You Superpowers”
- “Help Things You Care About”
- “Join the Mission, Save the World”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our first test included 15 titles, each which had 10 votes.  At $0.02 per vote, that’s $3.00 (plus a bit extra for using Turk), which is ridiculously cheap for market research. When all the votes come in, you can see an analysis that looks like this: [caption id=”attachment_76” align=”alignnone” width=”560”] <a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-10-at-10-02-54-am.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-10-at-10-02-54-am.png?w=800" alt="Answer Summary" /> </a> Answer Summary[/caption] [caption id=”attachment_77” align=”alignnone” width=”560”] <a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-10-at-10-05-40-am.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-10-at-10-05-40-am.png?w=800" alt="Result Summary" /> </a> Result Summary[/caption]<br />
## Initial Results
Our first batch of slogans had the following average ratings: [caption id=”attachment_78” align=”aligncenter” width=”560”] <a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-10-at-10-08-23-am.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-10-at-10-08-23-am.png?w=800" alt="Average Ratings for Each Slogan Option" /> </a> Average Ratings for Each Slogan Option[/caption] Surprised?  In general these matched our intuitions (“Contribute Huge Free” does sound quite bad in retrospect), but we definitely updated our assumptions.  I threw away the idea of making the app superhero themed.  While several of the slogans were items I never intended on using (I personally don’t like the phrase “Save the World”), the idea was to try out a broad space of possibilities to see what people liked and work from there.  At a cost of $0.20 - $0.40 per slogan, it makes sense to test out a lot of strange things. Does this rating perfectly match what will work for our business?  Of course not!  This was a simple test to see which phrases people liked, which could be very different from which ones are good to associate with our product.  The audience is a bit different; Mechanical Turk has mostly a varied sample of computer savvy Americans and our audience is more specific (mostly female). What this does provide us is a simple heuristic to help guide our decision of what messages to pay attention to.  Because we have so many choices, we can discard all that do worse than average and still have plenty of options. In addition, if you want to get better at marketing, one measurable way of doing so is predicting the scores new items will get and measuring the results against those.  We haven’t been doing that yet, but are considering it going forward.  Hypothetically individuals with the most decision power should be those with the most prediction power, and in cases like this, that could be figured out quite well. <img src="http://bowlabs.wordpress.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt="" title="More..." />
##</p>

<h2 id="iteration">Iteration</h2>
<p>Once our initial experiment was complete, we evaluated the best ones and used our thoughts to help come up with new ideas.  We re-tested a few winners as well as several of the variations and new slogans we came up with.  The worst performing slogans were not re-tested.  We’re under the impression that there’s a margin of error (90% confidence) on these of about 0.4 (probably a bit less when doing 20 votes per entree).  We’ll have to do testing and rigorous analysis to get a better idea.

## Conclusions
We’re still in the process of doing testing on both our slogan and our website, and this process of iterative Sentiment Analysis seems to be going quite well so far.  We intend to test much of our other text, advertising copy, and our logo the same way. <strong>Some Take-Aways and Suggestions</strong>
- Mechanical Turk Sentiment Analysis can be combined with Iteration to produce consistently well rated copy.  
- Don’t do multiple trials at once.  This burned me out when I tried.  A better strategy seems to be to do one test a day for several days, which allows you to come up with some new ideas.  Plus, it’s not fun to wait for Mechanical Turk to finish (it’s estimated deadline can keep on increasing)
- In general, do 20 votes per item.  I often did 10 by accident, and think I got worse results because of it.  The cost is almost trivial anyway.
- Try a wide variety of strange things.  Most won’t work, but the ones that will may surprise you.
- Try predicting how well each item will do before you get feedback.  This will give you an idea of how well you are calibrated to this specific crowd.</p>

        Using Feedback Army for Efficiency and Insight
      </a>
    </h2>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>I learned about <a href="http://www.feedbackarmy.com/" title="Feedbak Army">Feedback Army</a> when it launched a few years ago, and enjoyed it a whole lot then with <a href="http://holono.com/" title="Holono">Holono</a>.  It’s a service to send off questions you may have on your website and get customer feedback.  Feedback Army works by sending tasks to <a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome" title="Mechanical Turk">Mechanical Turk</a>, so essentially is a pretty wrapper, but I’ve found it to be a useful one.  The cost is not that much more than that on Mechanical Turk, and because Mechanical Turk has such a bad UI, it can actually make some sense. <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-04-at-3-57-52-am.png?w=710" alt="Image" /> Previously in user testing of Raise people liked the website but were very confused by our message.  We’re in the middle of changing our landing page, so decided to use Feedback Army to get 25 responses on what people thought of our site as is.  We used the service to ask each person the following questions: 1. What does this site do? 2. What aspect of the site confused you? 3. What would improve this site? 4. How does it work? 5. If you were to come up with a slogan for the website, what would it be? The responses were much more positive than we were expecting, with most grasping the idea of the website.  Of course, much of this may well have been because the reviewers didn’t want to spend much time on it and “it’s good” is an shorter answer than “it’s confusing…”   There was still a bit of confusion, some bug finds, and some decent suggestions.  A few select quotes below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“The only thing that would need improving would be to make any text that is in a light gray color more darker for those of us who can’t see.”</li>
  <li>“It was not clear what the site does until I scrolled down a little and read the description.”</li>
  <li>“On the /features/ page, the line “Each month we will send out checks with that month’s revenue to each cause in the amounts mentioned on the side.”, it’s somewhat unclear what “…amounts mentioned on the side” means. My immediate reaction was to look at the sidebar of the page I was currently on. It should just say “…amounts shown.” or “…amounts stated on the summary page.” or something along those lines.”</li>
  <li>“On the /donations/ page. The numerical values representing contributions increase in real-time. Even though the numbers increase in varying amounts, their synchronous second-by-second updates implies a possibility that the figures to not actually represent actual numbers, but are just a product of predefined scripts. Updates triggered by actual page loads (or at random intervals, simulating triggering) will have a better impact on perception of accuracy.”</li>
  <li>“I think it’s best that this site not have a slogan. Slogans are starting to become cliche if they haven’t already. The title itself serves as a great self-slogan, but could be better if depicted with an arrow pointing straight up after the “e”, implying “direct and constant growth” (Rather than the current logo with an curved arrow up and over the “R”, which can imply “Plateauing”, or “Attempted effort”).”</li>
  <li>“ If I was supposed to pay for something or not I couldn’t really tell.”</li>
</ul>

<p>—————————————- Most of the responses this time were incredibly short, though a few were quite good.  Next time we’ll probably go straight to Mechanical Turk and put emphasis on writing a longer description. One good part was that people suggested slogans, and some may be good.  Here are some of the better ones:
- “Raise Awareness, Raise Hope”
- “Browse the web, Raise money for the world” (Surprisingly similar to our previously considered possibility, “Browse the web, change the world”
- “Raise your Awareness!”
- “Browse and Bestow”
- “Saving while Surfing”
- “Relief Replace Rejoice”
- “Helping Others is Only One Click Away”
- “Browse. Donate. Smile”</p>

<p>We’ll test a few of these on Mechanical Turk.  Results will be posted as they come in.
## Lessons Learned</p>

<ol>
  <li>Feedback Army is convenient, though the responses can be very short.</li>
  <li>Most users do seem to understand what Raise does from our current website.</li>
  <li>The specific way we donate (per time spent from initial user registration) is still unclear and unintuitive.</li>
  <li>Users are still concerned over the risk of downloading browser extensions, and if the money is actually going to their nonprofits.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can see all of our feedback from Feedback Army <a href="http://www.feedbackarmy.com/get_feedback.slp?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.downloadraise.com&amp;code=e9fcb14f6e01ba18af71ac2848e87dc2" title="here">here</a>.</p>
