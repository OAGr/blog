      <p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/121378.jpg"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/121378.jpg?w=487" alt="Image" /> </a></p>

<p>Fishtraps are devices that are easy to enter and difficult or impossible to exit from.  Many products and web apps work the same way. One example may be the <a href="http://www.freecreditreport.com/">monthly service </a>that requires a short website to sign up to but a very long phone call process to stop.  Web services can do similar by making it really simple to sign up and start adding information, but almost impossible to export your data once you use the service. Companies spend a lot of time and effort optimizing their entrences.  There are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_14?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=landing%20page%20optimization&amp;sprefix=landing+page+o%2Caps%2C213&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Alanding%20page%20optimization">several books</a> on Landing Page Optimization / SEO / AB testing on acquiring users.  There’s basically nothing on how to allow users to gracefully leave. Easy web exiting capabilities for consumers would mean data (and permissions and API) interoperability which would mean open standards.  This is one big reason why open standards are important.  But open web standards over the last 10 years have been very rough and frustrating, much because of a reluctance of companies to allow their users to easily leave their platforms.   </p>

<h2 id="the-facebook-example">The Facebook Example</h2>
<p>To start using Facebook, there’s one clean landing page.  Once you get in, Facebook will give you lots of help finding friends for you.  They will then recommend you to people who “might” know you, to help make sure that you get comfortable quickly.  The entire process is incredibly simple and easy. But say you get tired of Facebook, and want to try Google+.  You can close your Facebook account, but they will keep the information forever (allowing you to re-enter as easily as possible).  If you search through the option settings, you may find that on the bottom of the “general account settings” page, there’s a way to “download a copy” of your Facebook data.  This brings you to another page, as shown below.</p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/screen-shot-2013-04-28-at-3-38-55-pm.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/screen-shot-2013-04-28-at-3-38-55-pm.png" alt="Facebook Archive Page" /> </a></p>

<p>If you click “Start My Archive”, you actually won’t get that much data.  The full archive link is actually that small “expanded archive” link on the bottom.  From there you enter your password and wait. Several hours later you’ll get an email letting you know your archive is ready.  It comes as a folder with several HTML webpages of your pictures, friends, private messages, and profile information.  Not CSV, not JSON, but HTML data. Then you realize that even that doesn’t have the status updates of you or your friends.  I don’t know how many people use Facebook primarily as a photo sharing service, but I’m going to go on a limb and say that the main thing people do on Facebook is post to and read from status updates.  So Facebook is essentially not giving the most important user data to them. And even then, there’s really no way I know of importing any of that data to Google+ or Twitter or Diaspora.  Because in order to do that, these programs would have to make a program that you would download, just to format this HTML and then upload it to another service. The saddest part is that even this is considered <strong>better than average</strong> for web services.</p>

<h2 id="solutions">Solutions</h2>
<p>The only existing protection against this seem to be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">EU’s legal action</a> and occasionally consumer sentiment. Hypothetically, it could be possible for a browser extension to warn users about lock-in on visits to website sign-up pages.  If enough people used these or did some research, it could be possible that companies would take notice and respond accordingly.  We really just need people to care. In the mean time, just realize.  When you are on these platforms, you are essentially in a fish trap.  Leaving may technically be feasible, but it’s made to be near impossible.   For more info on “evil web design” I recommend checking out “ <a href="http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9781118422144/index.html">Evil By Design</a>” by Chriss Nodder.The <a href="http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9781118422144/sloth.html">Sloth section</a> goes into detail in what I am calling the fishtrap.</p>

        An Information Availability Graph
      </a>
    </h2>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>Recently I’ve been thinking about the economics of sharing person information.   I get the sense that one reason why social networks are so important is because they allow you to share much more information than you would be otherwise.  In general, people seem to think that this a good thing, and I think that these following diagrams may help explain why.   By looking at information sharing in an economic way it may be easier to understand the existing inefficiencies of the “market” and some theoretical reasons for the emergence of social networks and group privacy settings within them.  </p>

<p><a href="http://raiseforgoodapp.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/1.png"> <img src="http://raiseforgoodapp.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/1.png" alt="A person has the most information about themselves available (typically). A much smaller subset of information is available to the public." /> </a>  </p>

<p>A person has the most information about themselves available (typically). A much smaller subset of information is available to the public.</p>

<p>First, I’ll start with the basic plot.  Imagine that you ordered everyone in the world by how willing you were to share information with them, and then plotted how much you would be willing to share with each person.  You would be all the way on the left, deserving of accessing everything.  Then all the way on the right is the general public.  You may share a few pictures of yourself and an email address, but many people choose to hide a lot of information from everybody.  </p>

<p><a href="http://raiseforgoodapp.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/comfortcurve.png"> <img src="http://raiseforgoodapp.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/comfortcurve.png" alt="The Comfort Curve shows the maximum amount of information that a person would feel comfortable sharing with X amount of people. The &quot;optimal&quot; setting would be for this to be completely filled with information." /> </a> </p>

<p>The Comfort Curve shows the maximum amount of information that a person would feel comfortable sharing with X amount of people. The “optimal” setting would be for this to be completely filled with information.  </p>

<p>The result of your ordering and plotting may be a “comfort curve”, which shows exactly how much information availability you would be comfortable with.  We can generally assume that this is what is optimal for the world, given the constraint of you being OK with it.  You being OK is particularly important because that is what you may be willing to share.  Theoretically we could make a model showing how much information should be available for a utilitarian scenario instead, but that would be much more complicated and not as relevant.  </p>

<p><a href="http://raiseforgoodapp.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/facebook.png"> <img src="http://raiseforgoodapp.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/facebook.png" alt="Different platforms allow different groups to access different amounts of your data." /> </a>  </p>

<p>Different platforms allow different groups to access different amounts of your data.  </p>

<p>The privacy of Facebook (and other social networking tools) allow them to promote sharing that would not go on websites.  This privacy enables more people to gain information (that you are fine with them getting) than would be otherwise.  </p>

<p><a href="http://raiseforgoodapp.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/facebook-groups.png"> <img src="http://raiseforgoodapp.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/facebook-groups.png" alt="Facebook added the concept of &quot;types&quot; of friends to help promote sharing. More information availability is possible with more groups to share with." /> </a>  </p>

<p>Facebook added the concept of “types” of friends to help promote sharing. More information availability is possible with more groups to share with.  </p>

<p>One thing a lot of people noticed was that as Facebook became more popular, people became less comfortable sharing on it.  Facebook originally went from being a tool for college friends to one of general acquaintances and colleagues.  Later Facebook allowed users to split their friends up into groups and share with each group separately, to help mitigate this.  Other social networks (Diaspora, Google+) have done this first (and arguably better).  </p>

<p><a href="http://raiseforgoodapp.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/group.png"> <img src="http://raiseforgoodapp.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/group.png" alt="The limitation of groups and mediums limits the information that can become available." /> </a>  </p>

<p>The limitation of groups and mediums limits the information that can become available.  </p>

<p>However, unless you have n groups for n friends, there’s always going to be some information you won’t share to some people because of the limitation of group number.  This “inefficiency” is shown in red.  </p>

<p><a href="http://raiseforgoodapp.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/convencience.png"> <img src="http://raiseforgoodapp.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/convencience.png" alt="The ability and convenience to share information to specific groups also limits information availability, as shown." /> </a>   </p>

<p>The ability and convenience to share information to specific groups also limits information availability, as shown.  </p>

<p>In addition, other information is either be inconvenient or impossible to share.  You probably don’t have access to a lot of information that exists and is about you.  You probably don’t share near all of the information with your facebook friends that you would feel comfortable with them having, because the cost of putting much of it on Facebook far exceeds the benefits that your friends would get from it.  For example, you may not mind at all if your close friends could get info on your GPS location most of the time, or what book you are currently reading, but it may be difficult/inconvenient to push that data to Facebook.  </p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, I think this may present an interesting model from which to build on.  It would be very interesting to make this quantitative, but realize that it would be very complicated.  Similar models could be made for businesses, organizations, etc.  This also doesn’t discuss what other people want to see; only what you are willing to show them. One of my goals with Feedhaven is to minimize both of these inefficiencies. Hypothetically, all of the information available to you (no matter the app) could have one generalized retrieval system.  In addition, one could imagine systems whereby it were incredibly simple and elegant to split up friends into tiny groups and to edit settings for each one.</p>

        What &#8216;Value&#8217; Should Mean
      </a>
    </h2>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>I would begin this post by stating that ‘value’ is one of the most mis-interpreted words in this era, except for the abysmally poor interpretation of all words, ever.  </p>

<p>The fact is that ‘values’ are really important if you define them correctly.  I think that most versions of the term are bit wrong, so I’ll try to give my shot at what a “value” is. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Value: A general concept that is associated with ‘goodness’.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a minor variation on that of Dictionary.com’s, which is:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Noun. ”The regard that something is held to deserve; the importance or preciousness of something: “your support is of great value”.”  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>With either of these definitions it seems difficult to say that “values” have declined at all, contrary what our stereotype of old grumpy people would argue.  Only that they have changed.  </p>

<p>Interestingly, people have studied the science behind memes (or ideas), but to my knowledge, values haven’t been looked at too much.  (Even meme science is still a relatively esoteric field for some reason).  The way I look at them, values are constructed from ideas.  Ideas are something of the brick to value’s buildings.  The ideas are important, but often they are hard to understand without seeing the bigger picture.  I believe that in comparison, values represent the bigger picture.  This means that instead of looking at the profile of ideas (or, the ‘meme-space’) regarding a group of people, a more useful map would be to pay attention to the values. </p>

<p><strong>Values guide people.</strong>  Values choose the different ideologies of Republicans and Democrats.  I imagine that changes in values map more directly in the actions of organizations than changes those of ideas or personal qualities.  A fundamental structure in the background of social organizations is their variance of specific values.  </p>

<p>For example, look at Bill Gates compared to Larry Ellison.  They may have similar ideas in their heads, but what’s really important right now are their differences of values.  I’m not saying that Bill Gates is more altruistic, but that his greater value of specific types of semi-charitable actions has led him to pursue those things to a great extent.  Larry Ellison has a different set of values, and lives accordingly.  Obviously he does not value open source software too much, if he did, that could make a dramatic change in the direction of Oracle.  </p>

<p><strong>Values can have positive feedback.</strong>  If you lightly value baseball, you may join a baseball team, where you will be surrounded by positive memes and associations to go with baseball.  You value it more, and gradually fall down the rabbit hole, considering more importance to what may otherwise be a somewhat trivial game, than to anything else in life.  You might have similar skill sets (besides some new muscle memory in Baseball), similar intelligence, etc, as other people, but your value system will put you in an incredibly different situation.  </p>

<p>Hitler and Winston Churchill were probably quite similar in most regards.  They probably knew much of the same history.  They both got enjoyment from sweetness and fat, both had to sleep every night.  However, their value systems were different in a few key areas, and combined with their incentive systems, they were opposite heads of a way.  </p>

<p>Perhaps there is much more variation in human values than human genes, and if so it may be more worthwhile to emphasize spreading your values more than your genes.  </p>

<p>This is a really messy subject.  I’ll come back to it later.  Most of the interesting work may come in future posts, but I wanted to define this a bit.</p>

        The Internet Is &#8220;Real Life&#8221;
      </a>
    </h2>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>The idea that the physical world some of us normally live in is “real” in any objective or absolute sense is a bit out of date and silly.  It seems like there’s a decent chance we may be in a <a href="http://news.discovery.com/space/are-we-living-in-a-computer-simulation-2-121216.htm">simulation</a>, and likely a greater chance we’re “in” something we couldn’t understand or comprehend if we were to find evidence for it.</p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/avatar.jpeg"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/avatar.jpeg?w=249" alt="Image" /> </a></p>

<p>So <strong>I’m sick of people considering online living as absolutely inferior to “physical” living</strong>.</p>

<p>There are some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Alone-Together-Expect-Technology-Other/dp/0465031463/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=libraryextension-20&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0465031463">valid reasons</a> for how people sometimes use specific technologies to unintentionally alienate and permanently damage themselves.  But these are specific to our existing state and definitely not to “all of technology” or the entire concept of the internet.  Intellectuals used to warn that people were absorbed in the artificial world of books which were tearing them from “reality”.  Now books are associated with goodness and intellect so no one really cares any more.  The same has yet to happen to the internet.</p>

<p>Gamers sometimes facilitate this illusion by using the term “IRL” (In Real Life) to refer to the non-gaming world.  I think this may be a destructive term.  The world they are referring to may not be less real than the one they are in, only something very different.  </p>

<p>This does leave the awkward question of what to exactly call this plane of existence.  It seems strange to call it a reality, unless one considers ‘reality’ a loose term that is expanded to online universes and ones we don’t know about.  Comic writers used the word “universe” to discern the places between different stories, but this signifies them as non-combining entities, while the ‘realities’ I’m referring to often take place somewhat inside each other.  I’m sure this is one bit that went into the term IRL as not a definitive one but as something people will use until someone can come up with something better.</p>

<p>One awesome quote from Wikipedia:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Some  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociologist" title="Sociologist">sociologists</a> engaged in the study of the Internet have predicted that someday, a distinction between online and real-life worlds may seem “quaint”, noting that certain types of online activity, such as sexual intrigues, have already made a full transition to complete legitimacy and “reality”. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_life#cite_note-Slater-2">[2]</a>”  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note: A few weeks after writing this post I read more into <a href="http://watch.tpbafk.tv/">“Away from Keyboard”</a>, which I think is an appropriate term.  However, I prefer “meatspace”.</p>

You’ve probably heard of several stories of people posting false information on Wikipedia.  It seems to be the number one type of story I hear about Wikipedia.  And these stories are used to explain why we shouldn’t be allowed to site Wikipedia or pay much attention to it as our primary source of knowledge.  </p>

<p>The trouble with this thinking is that most people seem to pay less attention to the stories of poor academic writing, or news articles, or just about every other thing written in any language ever.  </p>

<p>Wikipedia acknowledges that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer"> it has problems with accuracy</a>.  Most other groups have similar problems, but many won’t say so, for obvious reasons. </p>

<p>My main fear is that universities and organizations ban Wikipedia references as a way to feign truth where little exists.  The stark reality, from my perspective, is that the vast majority of information all of us see is misrepresented, incomplete, false, and irrelevant.  People, journalists, scientists, often tell stories instead of facts, and even the facts are carefully chosen (though not always intentionally).  Bias is absolutely everywhere and so far Wikipedia seems to be the best item, to my knowledge, to try to counter it.  It’s a tiny attempt in comparison to the size of the problem, but it seems unfortunate to pin it as the enemy. </p>

<p><strong>I think that people like to use Wikipedia as a scapegoat and shove it under a bus.  But the problem isn’t Wikipedia, the problem is the inherently biased nature of humanity and lack of care or infrastructure to address this.</strong> </p>

<p>So I agree that Wikipedia is uncertain.  But it’s probably much better than what’s in my head currently about almost everything ever.  I think we need to just admit that most of what we know is very flawed and accept that all communicated and known information is imperfect, because it is.  Incredibly so.</p>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>It pains me to no avail that people consider blog posts as unique snapshots of time rather than pure information, similar to a personal wiki.  By this I mean that it is quite rare for bloggers to continually change their posts in significant ways long after publication.  Perhaps posts could have version numbers and history similar to wikipedia.  Rather than being time stamped, they would be somewhat timeless. Here’s one version of how I imagine that iteration should work on a blog.  </p>

<p>It’s really difficult to figure out what people will like in advance.  But it seems like viral hits happen really quickly, so few people expect to be able to change content mid-storm.  Thus they sometimes try to future-proof everything by making it better such that if/when it becomes viral, it will be ready and optimized for it.  </p>

<p>But this means they write much less! This is one model that would be cool in the theory of long-term traffic, but definitely is not optimized for “viral storms”.  It’s a pity.</p>

      <p>Facebook may be colored blue because Mark Zuckerberg happened to be <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/nov/25/generation-why/?pagination=false">red-green colorblind</a>.  Now over 1 billion people see a blue page for 5+ hours a month because of it.  This is one small and rather innocent example of what happens when one person gets incredible power, which the web enables in ways never really seen before.  </p>

Facebook, with no red or green.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Facebook-Effect-Company-Connecting/dp/1439102120/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=libraryextension-20&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1439102120">The Facebook Effect</a>, David Kirkpatrick mentions a few stories of Mark Zuckerberg analyzing user behavior over social networks.  What Mark realized, very early on, was that social networks had incredible economies of scale.  I don’t think the book mentioned <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed's_law">Reed’s Law</a>, but I do think it is particularly relevant. From Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Reed’s law</strong> is the assertion of  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_P._Reed" title="David P. Reed">David P. Reed</a> that the  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility" title="Utility">utility</a> of large  <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Network" title="wiktionary:Network">networks</a>, particularly  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network" title="Social network">social networks</a>, can  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth" title="Exponential growth">scale exponentially</a> with the size of the network.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Phrased differently, social networks are essentially incredibly monopolistic.  While there used to be competition at the start of the social network space, the game is now rigged and the king of the hill is miles up.  It’s as if, for some strange reason, the most popular coffee shop in San Francisco by 2014 would gain permission to replace 80% of all international global coffee shops.  Even if there was an initially fair playing ground, and no obvious unfair play, the results can be very scary. </p>

<p>Now Facebook has over one billion users, who spend an average of over <a href="http://www.insidefacebook.com/2012/03/27/users-spent-more-than-10-5b-total-minutes-per-day-on-facebook-in-january-not-including-mobile-use/">10 minutes a day</a> on the service.  That adds up to a lot of time by a lot of people.  I spend more time with Facebook personally than I do doing my taxes or relating to my government.  In many ways, Facebook is more important than most world governments, especially given how universal it is.  It’s far larger and time consuming than the vast majority of social structures now and throughout all history. </p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/comscore-share-time-spent-on-socnet-sites-in-dec-feb2013.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/comscore-share-time-spent-on-socnet-sites-in-dec-feb2013.png" alt="Time Spent on Social Networking Sites" /> </a> Time Spent on Social Networking Sites  </p>

<p>The 10 minutes on Facebook per day leaves out the influence of Facebook on the rest of the web, where their social buttons and integration is heavily tied to sites that I bet most people spend way more time on.  Facebook has a strange and powerful control of the future of the internet.  They ask and millions of websites put up metadata tags in a way that seems unparalleled to anything seen before. </p>

<p>Even after IPO, Mark Zuckerberg still owns over <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/financial/2012/05/28/120528ta_talk_surowiecki">58% of all of Facebook voting shares,</a>  He effectively controls everything Facebook.  While it is refreshing that he wasn’t screwed (as happens with many entrepreneurs), this high level of control is frightening.  Thousands of people worked on the product for possibly tens of thousands of man years, millions of people have directly participated in making the platform so incredibly successful, but because of the strange way the first few years played out Mark was able to keep over 58% of absolutely all control to himself.  It’s true that he “only” owns about 20% of the equity, but does this matter in comparison?  </p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/funny-facebook-pigs-talking.jpg"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/funny-facebook-pigs-talking.jpg" alt="funny-Facebook-pigs-talking" /> </a>  </p>

<p>A particularly popular political comic about Facebook</p>

<p>What does it mean when one person possesses control over millions like this? Online locations are not that much different from physical ones.  Facebook has become a fundamental technology relied on by hundreds of millions of people.  It doesn’t seem much different or less important than the beginnings of the electric system or telephone network.  And one guy owns it.  When AT&amp;T, controlled by a small management team, had too much power the government split it up.  It was then worth about one half as much as Facebook now (adjusted for inflation). </p>

<p>Mark seems to be a benevolent dictator.  He’s probably much better than the alternative of a set of mediocre managers and board members with interests mixed between corporate profit and self promotion, which is the standard in the industry.  People admit that Facebook would have gotten sold a long ago without him, and I believe that his vision for the future of Facebook is more long-term than anyone else conventionally put in power of technical companies.  But it does open up the question of what government systems we think are just and reasonable.  </p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/facebook-protest-003.jpg"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/facebook-protest-003.jpg" alt="One of many Facebook protests, that no one really paid attention to or cared about." /> </a> One of many Facebook protests, that no one really pays attention to or cares about.  </p>

<p>When Rome changed to a dictatorship (essentially), it started out quite well.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus_Ceasar">Augustus</a> was a smart guy who was essentially an effective benevolent dictator.  But future leaders were not so kind or intelligent, and everything fell apart shortly thereafter.  The one saving grace with regards to Facebook is that because of technological disruption it is quite possible that Facebook’s empire will fall or become obsolete before they run into the worst problems of incredibly personal control.  But it’s not certain and is definitely not a good long term fail safe. The question of the power roles of founders is the fundamental question of <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/nov/25/generation-why/?pagination=false">Political Philosophy</a>.  While academics debate this in ivory towers, coders are on the ground making important decisions now.  And they seem to be deciding on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_Dictator_for_Life">dictatorships</a> and anarchies.  For all the talk of how we love democracy, there’s surprisingly little of it being created.  We jam Democracy down the throats of tiny countries in Africa but don’t seem to notice it for the emergence of gigantic digital communities and infrastructure many times the size.  There are some reasons for this of course, but I believe this represents a serious case of cognitive dissonance that should be rigorously investigated and understood.  My honest guess is that we’ll determine that we very much need to disperse power online, but also realize that Democracy isn’t as important or holy to us as we’d like to believe.  </p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/untitled-1.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/untitled-1.png" alt="Mark doesn't dress like this, but he possesses far more power than perhaps all who have." /> </a><br />
Mark doesn’t dress like this, but he may possess more power than almost all who have.  </p>

<p>Facebook even attempted Democracy, but did it poorly.  As in, worse than China or Iran poorly (though, to be fair, not with nearly as dire consequences so far).  They put their new data use policy and statement of rights up for vote with the general public.  350,000 users ended up voting, and 6/7th of them voted “no”.  Unfortunately Facebook required that 300 million+ people voted for quorum by the closing date, which obviously did not happen, so Facebook went ahead and made the changes anyway.  If something similar were to happen to a third world country we’d consider them completely corrupt and juvenile.  Here it happens to us and we don’t care to notice.  Read  <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/06/whopping-00038-of-facebook-users-vote-on-data-use-policy-change/">this</a> and <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mtpiii/the-end-of-the-facebook-democracy">this</a> for more info. </p>

<p>The bottom line is that now, millions of people have no say in a community they are all contributing to.  In fact, they  <a href="http://www.nbcwashington.com/the-scene/events/Facebook-Users-on-Verge-of-Mutiny-130288643.html">violently oppose</a> every single update Facebook gives them, but the one ruler doesn’t care.  Perhaps he shouldn’t.  But we need to do some careful considering of what power structures and governments we are willing to accept and promote.  We also should re-consider what democracy really is and how important it should be.  Things will only get more messy from here.  </p>

        Can Anyone Predict the Long-term Future of the Internet? Part 1
      </a>
    </h2>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>For most of my life I wanted to be a hardware engineer (at first inventor) because that’s where I thought the future would be.  My basic theory was that all the great historic inventors worked with hardware, so that would be where the future was going as well.  I went so far as to spend 4 years getting an incredibly painful engineering degree to make this happen.</p>

<p>Halfway through that degree I took a trip to Singapore for study abroad, and there I realized I was probably making a wrong decision.  I continued to rationalize it for the next two years to stay motivated, but I realize now I probably would have been better off studying computer science.</p>

<p>In Singapore I took long walks every night and thought about science and futurism (rather than doing homework, which you weren’t required to turn in).  During this time I was working on <a href="http://holono.com/">Holono</a>; not because I wanted to work on software, but because I really wanted to see it get made.  The incredibly safe atmosphere made it convenient to walk around at night time, which is my best time for coming up with ideas.  I’d spend 2-4 hours a night thinking, and partially because of Holono, paying a lot of attention to the internet.</p>

<p>Here I came up with with a lot of my own ideas for what the internet could do.  I’ll announce them later on, but it amazed me what I came up with.</p>

        Can Anyone Predict the Long-term Future of the Internet?
      </a>
    </h2>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>Here’s a trend I’ve noticed: when discussing internet technologies, people talk about the next 1-5 years.  When discussing hardware, people talk in the next 200.</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="http://www.coverbrowser.com/covers/popular-science/19">these magazine covers</a>.  Or these, or these.  They typically feature hardware or tough sciences that won’t be developed commercially for 5-50 years, or web products that are out right now.  I had a club called Future Tech in college where we would discuss future technology, and we would typically do the same thing.  All cool “future tech” was either hardware or A.I.</p>

<p>The weirdest thing is that the internet companies are the ones getting funded.  They’re the ones doing ridiculously well, and they’ve only been around for the last 20 years.</p>

<p>The main explanation I have for that is that no one really understands the internet.  Compared to nanobots and hydrogen energy, the internet feels very confusing and unpredictable.  Lectures can discuss long term advances in hardware can present cool looking graphics with relatable visions.  But the few discussions I’ve seen on the long term vision of the internet is far more esoteric.  The internet utopian movement seems long dead and forgotten, as well the movement behind the semantic web, which to my knowledge, only about 50 people understand.  Yet everyone knows about electric cars.</p>

<p>The lean startup grew from the internet.  Unlike hardware and scientific tech, where breakthroughs come through optimizations and numeric improvements (this car is more efficient, this drug is far more effective), recent internet companies often create completely new value propositions.</p>

<p>One common assumption is that because we can’t see the future of the internet, there won’t be one.  I have many incredibly intelligent friends who consider the internet to be fairly complete, with the major future advances to be expected in fields like medicine, robotics, etc.  And with the current discussion of the internets’ future, this makes a lot of sense.  Yet I don’t see any numeric proof of this or anything.  Very few people predicted any of the existing web companies (Facebook, Google, Twitter, Groupon, etc).  Internet business incubators are growing (they are about all of the incubators that exist, really).  Unlike clean tech or biotech VCs, internet VC firms are doing well and are staying bullish.</p>

<p>Yet the real evidence for me has come from my ideas.  When I consider the future of hardware, I typically wind myself coming up with ideas that would either help a small subset of the population or take forever to create and require technology that doesn’t exist yet.  When I consider the future of the internet, I come up with things that could be made today and possibly help billions of people.</p>

<p>In addition, I’m quite sure that many of the next big fields will happen inside the internet.  In the same way that the electric industry was an unexpected creation using the byproducts of the steel industry, and the computer industry was an unexpected creation using the byproducts of the electric industry, and the internet industry came from the computer industry, I bet things will come from the internet.</p>

        Awards Imply False Certainty
      </a>
    </h2>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>In high school I got sick of most award systems.  Prizes were given like “best science student” or “2nd best musician” like “best” really meant something.  I also was questionable of whether the negative externalities created by these systems offset the positive benefit for the recipients and close friends, but I think the more pressing issue is the implied certainty. </p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/donc355.jpg"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/donc355.jpg" alt="obligatory average photograph of standard trophies" /> </a><br />
Obligatory average photograph of standard trophies</p>

<p>What the hell does it mean to be the “best science student”?  Most of the time people have little idea what “best” actually refers to, but rather assume it’s within a space of shared understanding that the local community will agree upon.  This is not always true, especially when there are disagreements about the winner.  Should the “best” book be one with <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2012/07/letter-from-the-pulitzer-fiction-jury-what-really-happened-this-year.html">more character emphasis, or verbal eloquence</a>?  In some cases it’s obvious how to rank items according to this vague space of shared understanding, but in other cases it’s apparent that the space isn’t narrow at all. </p>

<p>Even this assumes a level of consistency of mindset and competency of judges, which may be and often is highly questionable.  Just because a person may be an “expert” at their field doesn’t mean they are any good at it.  They may just be the best of ignoramuses. </p>

<p>We can of course overcome this in part by assigning high uncertainty to our prizes and phases. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This award is given to the person who our team of three specific, somewhat randomly chosen but assumingly competent (according to our school’s current department standards)  people.  Using our current understanding of what likely makes up “excellent”, we have predicted that this entree is the most likely to be the best one.  If we had chosen a different group of judges from a similar group and this had been done again, we predict that there would be a 40% chance of this entree still winning 1st place.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, few organizations will ever do this.  It hurts the often false sense of their own authority.  It makes the competition seem rather unimportant, even though it likely is. </p>

<h2 id="my-counterplan">My CounterPlan</h2>

<p>In high school I designed a small representation of this, in a “Seal of Perceived Excellence”.  I finally purchased a custom stamp in the beginning of college.  I considered it accurate on my homework, when I would spend a lot of time doing a job I thought was decent, but knowing I probably got some fundamental elements wrong and had little idea of how well I actually did.  While now I look back on it and find the design a bit childish, I still like the point and would later be interested in extending it elsewhere.  <a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/seal.jpeg"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/seal.jpeg" alt="Ozzie Gooen Seal of Perceived Excellence" /> </a> Ozzie Gooen Seal of Perceived Excellence</p>

        Why Obsessives May Hate Scheduling Meetings

      <p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/b1_north_hallway1.jpg"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/b1_north_hallway1.jpg" alt="Not Harvey Mudd, but close." /> </a></p>

<p>I remember at <a href="http://www.hmc.edu/">Harvey Mudd College</a> I would often be really interested in really specific technical topics and go through great difficulties to talk to anyone about them, especially the professors.  Many of the engineering professors would be out during all of the convenient times for me (after 5pm M-T, and most of Friday because most seemed to be out consulting).   Sure I could schedule meetings, but that didn’t feel right.  I wanted to walk in and start talking. </p>

<p>It recently dawned on me what very quick discussion was so important to me.  It was because I knew I would loose interest quickly and wanted to get my thoughts out while they were with me.  I would often hours or days on end obsessing on an issue, and all of it was fresh and new to my memory right then.  Scheduling a meeting a week after would throw everything off. Not only was it not convenient, but I had no way of knowing what I would be interested in the next week. I notice this now.  I plan meetings about partnerships, then get really excited about product development and loose interest in the meetings.  It makes it really hard to hold discussions with other people in the area.  <strong>Therefore it seems very important to have a large variety of people in my general vicinity that will handle my somewhat unpredictable interests while being close enough not to have to schedule an appointment any more than a few hours away.</strong> </p>

<p>Fortunately I’m living with 17 other smart people in <a href="http://risesf.com/">Rise SF</a>, which definitely is a plus.  But the location is restricting (Twin Peaks, SF) and I don’t interact routinely with large groups of people outside the house. Maybe this is one reason why <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_20">building 20</a> and similar tightly packed intelectual networks work so well.  Even if people <strong>can</strong> meet each other doesn’t mean it will be convenient; them being able to stop in at a whim may be significantly more efficient and productive.  This way they can discuss what they are interested in, in the moment they are interested in it.  </p>

<p>More information on <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/01/30/120130fa_fact_lehrer?currentPage=all">Building 20</a> here, toward the end.  It’s a fascinating read.</p>

      <p>From Mechanical Turk:

<p>Sentiment Analysis on Mechanical Turk</p>

<p>The interface is relatively simple.  You pick  an item (a slogan, for example), a question (“rate how much you like this slogan”), and then upload a .csv file with a list of all the possible slogans you want to test out.  You can choose anywhere between 10-20 ratings for each, which we’ve found to give a pretty consistant response. We tried out this technique with several slogan ideas we were considering.  But before I show you the response, try guessing the order that people preferred the following list:
- “Eyes Save Lives”
- “Charity Done Right”
- “Donate Without Paying”
- “We Give You Superpowers”
- “Help Things You Care About”
- “Join the Mission, Save the World”</p>

<p>Our first test included 15 titles, each which had 10 votes.  At $0.02 per vote, that’s $3.00 (plus a bit extra for using Turk), which is ridiculously cheap for market research. When all the votes come in, you can see an analysis that looks like this:</p>

        Making a Really Confusing Hackathon in 24 Hours (#ifwehadglass)
      </a>

      <p><a href="http://www.google.com/glass/start/how-to-get-one/"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-25-at-3-17-00-pm1.png?w=922" alt="Google's #ifihadglass competition page" /> </a> Google’s <a href="http://www.google.com/glass/start/how-to-get-one/"> #ifihadglass </a></p>

<p>After Google’s #ifihadglass competition came out, I thought it might be fun to make some entrees, given our research at Harvey Mudd in wearable computing.  While I was put off by the $1500 price tag, Rahul pointed out that they would likely have an ebay value quite a bit over that, so I decided to go with it.  We came up with the idea of organizing a small hackathon to come up with entrees, and after me asking a few people on Facebook, decided to make it happen.  However, this was on Wednesday, and the only day fit for the Hackathon was Saturday (it ended the week after), so we didn’t have much time to make it happen. </p>

<p>The domain <a href="http://www.ifwehadglass.com/">ifwehadglass.com</a> was available, so I decided to go with it.  Then I searched iStock Photo for an image somewhat similar to the google one, but with more people.  I found one, made a <a href="https://twitter.com/ifwehadglass">Twitter page</a>, made a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/572165209460571/">Facebook event</a>, and finally started a website.  Taking significant inspiration from the Google Glass website, I put together some custom CSS to make my own similar version, as shown below.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.ifwehadglass.com/"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-25-at-3-56-33-pm.png?w=922" alt="Original #ifwehadglass hackathon website" /> </a>  </p>

<p>Original #ifwehadglass hackathon website </p>

<p>The hardest part was the hosting it, which I did on Thursday evening after going to bed at 6.  After a bit of searching I found <a href="http://www.site44.com/">Site44</a>, which hosts websites straight out of Dropbox.  Awesome. Submitted it on Hacker News hoping to make front page.  <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5261470">Kind of did.</a></p>

<p>Hacker News (selected) reactions below.<br />

<p>The last thing was to edit the website so that everyone could have their own page for their own entrees.  We made subdirectories for each entrant who signed up on Facebook.  Originally the plan was that each person would be able to access only their own folder.  However, we quickly realized that this would be a limitation.  First, it was impossible to share a folder from an app, so we had to switch from Site44 to one of <a href="https://twitter.com/Joevm3">Joe’s</a> many servers.  Then we realized that it’s impossible to share a folder with a few people, and share subfolders with other people.  So instead we just gave everyone access to everything.  In this case it’s fine, but you can imagine that it’s not a very scalable.  Come on, Dropbox! Some attempts were made at getting someone from Google to come with a Google Glass for the event, but they were made in vain.  Fortunately, the event was fun for the people who made it.            </p>

<p>I’m sick of how the web and link bate distract me from time and value.  As a small bit of resistance, I’m writing a browser extension that finds all words related to celebrities and pop culture and gently whites them out for me.  In addition it vastly covers related pictures.  We’ll play around with it, and if it proves fun may release it on the chrome store or integrate it as an optional add-on to Raise. </p>

        Most of What I&#8217;m Writing Is Probably Wrong
      </a>
    </h2>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>The world is really complicated.  So when I, or anyone else comes across with a point, we’re doing so with a very limited set of information.  Even the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/07/pundit-forecasts-all-wrong-silver-perfectly-right-is-punditry-dead/">experts</a> typically get things wrong.  That makes it pretty hopeless for anyone else.</p>

<p>That said, we need to pretend we know things.  Why?  Because everyone else does, and if you admit that you don’t know things people will believe you.  But they will continue believing those who pretend to know things, so you’ll look worse in comparison.  It’s like a bizarre athletic contest where everyone is cheating with hacks and steroids and those who don’t quickly get kicked out for not doing well in comparison.  </p>

<p>I’m quite sure that one can only read the intelligence of less intelligent people.  It’s kind of like Jazz; to an untrained ear <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Parker">Charlie Parker</a> could sound as good as some amateur enthusiast.  I realized this quickly when I played jazz; no matter how good I actually was, if I played loud and confident during my solos people would assume I knew more than them and was actually quite impressive if only they understood jazz a bit better.  </p>

<p>So when I talk I’ll continue to state things like they are true, even though I completely realize that most of them are highly uncertain.  I’ve been considering making a new language for this similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime">E-prime,</a> but it probably wouldn’t help much for normal conversation.</p>

<p>This is important to accept because otherwise I would never say things.  I realize that much of what I talk about has been discussed before.  I could theoretically research every subject to its academic end and argue the points for those who know where the subject elite stand.  But the only people who typically do this, are the PHDs who spend a few years doing nothing but researching the literature to find this end.  Which means I would be constrained to one very specific field, and spend several years of life achieving that.  </p>

<p>What I’m saying is that the ends don’t matter too much because they are likely to be wrong.  And there’s probably some very interesting optimization process in deciding how much information you have to know about an argument to be able to contribute to it.  But the most important information is buried within the individual arguments and ideas to back them up.  The outcomes and weighing of those arguments is less important because there are probably many that I’m unaware of given my limited expertise.  </p>

<p>So I’ll continue to talk and listen to things that interest me, no matter how much I know about them.  And even if my general mentality is wrong (it likely will be much of the time), I hope that I have things to say within them that may be useful to the greater information.</p>

        Just What Are We Giving Our Soldiers?
      </a>
    </h2>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/care-packages.jpg"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/care-packages.jpg?w=490" alt="Image" /> </a></p>

<p>Take a brief look at <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Support-Deployed-US-Troops">this article</a>.  Common advice to give help to soldiers involves guessing what kinds of things they may find valuable and shipping them halfway around the world.  If it’s to a battalion you don’t know supposedly you are encouraged to add a letter and hope they write back.</p>

<p>What is this?  Do they live on another planet?  Many of them have i <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080201144458AAqBpHH">nternet connections</a>.  In 5 seconds we should be able to start a Skype call with them.  We have websites like Amazon now that send you what you actually want, not a hodgepodge guess of what someone halfway across the world may come up with by reading a Wikihow article (or more often, not reading anything).  </p>

<p>This “let’s guess and give” strategy seems mediocre for 2,000 years ago.  </p>

<p>In addition, what is wrong with us that soldiers crave basic goods like <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Support-Deployed-US-Troops">socks and toothpaste</a>.  My guess is that the military provides them with basic essentials but few brand names or “luxuries” (very cheap ones).  They acknowledge that these items are nice and useful (they are fine with them coming as care packages) but won’t give them to their soldiers for some reason.  Strange budgeting perhaps?  </p>

<p>The few web services that support this thing seem to be <a href="http://www.adoptaussoldier.org//">stuck</a> <a href="http://www.give2thetroops.org/">2</a> <a href="http://operationonceinalifetime.com/">decades</a> ago.  </p>

<p>I would strongly imagine that if care packages were important, a team within the government would set up a really strong application to match people with soldiers and communicate with them and send them items they really care about.  Or better yet, Amazon should work out something to help send any possible item upon their request to their place (although I realize that some items may be limited).  Amazon should get on this if they haven’t yet.</p>

<p>But there should definitely be something better if we are to take this seriously; it’s both very possible and important.  If Americans actually care about soldiers, we might as well get serious about it and do it well.  </p>

<p>Footnote: One could say that the primary use of these care packages is to show support, not give basic goods.  But why then do soldiers request basic goods from care packages?  Plus, even if it was to provide support, maybe there could be some way of connecting similar donors with similar soliders (though this is a minor issue in comparison)</p>

<p>  Social feedback is really good at making people ordinary.  People don’t like strange things, and the negative reinforcement is quite quick and powerful. Most of the posts I’ve read about how to <a href="http://www.problogger.net/how-to-write-great-blog-content/">write</a> <a href="http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/writing-a-good-blog.html"> good</a> <a href="http://smallbiztrends.com/2012/11/7-steps-to-writing-a-great-blog-post.html">blog</a> <a href="http://www.blogohblog.com/10-tips-for-writing-good-content-and-attracting-readers/">posts</a> talk about how to write good blog posts for blog popularity.  Which makes sense if you’re optimizing your blog for popularity, but I don’t think I am.  I’m trying to get my crazy thoughts out of my head before I forget them, and decided that I might as well improve my writing while doing it.  Plus I enjoy the fact that someone out there may find some of this interesting and perhaps engage me in a conversation more interesting than standard smalltalk nonsense. So if I were writing to be popular I wouldn’t do as well.  I’d worry when I wasn’t becoming popular.  I’ve tried writing posts before, submitting them on hacker news, waiting, and being disappointed when they wouldn’t become popular.  I stopped doing this, but now my posts are automatically posted on Twitter and Facebook.  I then get feedback from them, plus comments on the bottom of the post.  These are not harmless.  They put a metric in how well I’m doing, with a re-tweet count or like count or comment count.  The atmosphere encourages people to optimize for that which is easily seen and measurable, which is a problem because it’s not what I’m trying to optimize for!  It’s like school constantly reminding me of my G.P.A. when I’m trying my hardest not to care about my G.P.A. so I could get on to more important things.  At worst I accept someone else’s quite arbitrary measure of success, and at best I end up feeling a bit bad about myself because I did poorly on something that doesn’t matter to me anyway. First I’m trying my best to reject the standard definition of blog success.  Second I’ve changed the Wordpress updates to only some of my Facebook friends.  Ideally I would be able to have different friend groups see different sets of posts, but from what I understand nothing supports this (except maybe Google+, but few people I know use that anyway).  There’s actually a Facebook setting to help with this, though it’s really mediocre and hard to use.

There’s a lot more that I considered putting here, but I’ll just add it to later posts.  And if you’re disappointed that this post feels short and incomplete, then I don’t care anyway, because I don’t care about popularity.  :)  At least for this blog.  </p>

After doing a bit of research I found that I’m not the  <a href="http://www.joshspeters.com/how-to-optimize-the-ogdescription-tag-for-search-and-social">only one to notice this.</a>  Apparently LinkedIn and Google+ both use the Facebook OG tags to represent websites to people. Apparently Facebook realized that they needed good metadata to make sense of websites to show to people on their feed.  Metadata existed, but few seemed to be using it (except for SEO, which typically is a bit different than information users themselves are interested in).  The Semantic Web people have long tried to make sense and popularize metadata.  So it seems quite interesting that Facebook may be the organization to finally popularize it for the masses.   Facebook made the Open Graph for Facebook.  It’s really hard to tell how “open” they actually want it to be: whether they intend the open graph to be a Facebook dominated platform, or a universal one that Facebook can rely upon.  This is a really interesting question to me and I’ll definitely keep it in mind over the next few years.  Either way, it may be becoming the standard for other people to use as metadata. What does this mean?  Well, maybe you can incorporate Open Graph metadata from other applications into your website for starters.  More interesting relationships would be difficult, but it seems possible to scrape Open Graph data from websites to do things that could be interesting.  Facebook tags don’t really provide semantic data regarding the relationships between different objects, but some of this may be possible to be added using other services.</p>

        The Need for a Rigorous Morality
      </a>
    </h2>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>When making life decisions about morality, reasons aren’t always good enough.  We need numbers. Quick challenge:  Try calculating the answers to the following questions, optimizing for the benefit of mankind.</p>

<ul>
  <li> How much should you tip waiters?</li>
  <li>Should you visit a family reunion or stay at home and do extra work?</li>
  <li>Should you go to a party at least once this month, or stay home and do work?</li>
  <li>Should you become a doctor or a politician?</li>
</ul>

<p>These are four everyday questions for someone trying to do good in the world in a somewhat optimal way.  For any of them we could come up with a few basic hypothesis followed by assumptions followed by a very uncertain decision.  However, I wonder what the optimal answers could be using all of existing human knowledge.  My guess is that these answers should be much better than what one of us may come up with in a few minutes or years. I’m looking for a rigorous infrastructure from which to make choices to optimize definitions of what is good with as high certainty as possible.  I define “good” in a utilitarian sense, but this could be modifiable.  Even in “utilitarian”, a definition of “utility” is quite flexible and open-ended.  The important thing is that there is an efficient way of optimizing for definitions of good, many of which are quite similar anyways. I expect many members of this site to already use simple Fermi calculations when making important decisions.  Right now that does seem to be about the most rigorous thing one can do.  However, Fermi calculations are very much constrained by the information you have available to you.  I still think Fermi calculations are important, but I would like a system to give us standards and heuristics to make them more feasible and useful. For example, take the problem above, “how much should you time waiters?”  A basic Fermi model may make estimations on all of the costs and benefits of tipping waiters, then do a few calculations and arrive at an answer. <strong>Advantages of tipping a waiter:</strong>
- a1) Help out the waiter financially
- a2) Make the waiter feel better
- a3) Make the waiter treat you better later on
- a4) Make yourself feel better
- a5) Convince yourself that you are a better person</p>

<p><strong>Advantages of not tipping a waiter:</strong>
- b1) More money to support existential risk / a better cause
- b2) Convince yourself that you are a better person (for some hardcore utilitarians)</p>

<p>Perhaps you conclude that by far the most important advantage is a4 and the most important disadvantage is b1, but even then this is a highly uncertain equation.  How do you best quantify how much better the tip would make you feel, and how will that impact your productivity in life?  Exactly how much will a few cents reduce existential risk?  Simple answers to these questions lead to more questions until one finally uses either intuition (my salary is fixed, so a productivity increase would probably have a “small” benefit) or heuristics (I’ve read somewhere that $1 is worth 3 future lives), which are what finally allow one to solve the problem analytically.  However, this rests on several assumptions, is highly uncertain, and takes a lot of time to do. A substantially more rigorously thought out moral system would be able to provide answers like: “When an average San Francisco waiter gets $1 extra income, global utility increases by approximately 15 +- 7 “utils”.  When an average San Francisco waiter is tipped $1, the emotional gratification upon that waiter increases by approximately 5 +- 3 utils. I don’t think this is impossible, just difficult.  The important thing to remember is that we don’t need a framework that is excellent or anywhere near perfect. We just need one that gives us answers that are a bit better than we would normally do.  Given that humans tend to not think about issues like this all too much, this may not be that difficult. <strong>Challenges with a Rigorous Morality</strong>
1. Accepting optimization as a moral system.  Many people object to the idea of optimizing as a moral framework.  Because this community is so accepting of utilitarian ideas, I won’t spend much time on this.
2. Complexity.  The calculation above of the tip got to be slightly complex.  A full and complete calculation could be arbitrarily large.  For example, just to calculate the benefit of a1, you may first look at happiness to income curves, then estimate the average family and friend size of the waiter to begin predicting the positive influence on people around the waiter.  There may be clever ways to simplify and approximate this, but it would take a lot of thought and still result in a very complex answer.  Most fermi problems are relatively simple, and humans definitely aren’t used to figuring things like this out on a routine basic.  A rigorous, scientific morality would do the heavy lifting and provide simple, but relatively correct, answers.
3. Uncertainty.  Many calculations involved in deciding what helps the world most are very uncertain.  Calculations may involve many assumptions, each of which would carry some uncertainty.  So the end result is incredibly open ended.  Most scientific statements aren’t statistical, but essentially every single social statement is.  Will purchasing a dog provide over $100 in extra productivity to you per day?  We could run scientific studies on how dogs have helped other people become happy, and how happiness in your specific specialization results in productivity, but even then there would still be quite a bit of uncertainty.  More difficult problems are obviously worse.When doing math, any calculations of large social phenomena will have a lot of uncertainty.  Even with the best of existing knowledge, we may only be able to estimate the benefit of a dollar on existential risk reduction by a few orders of magnitude.  However, even though this is very messy, it should still be better than our basic intuitions.  In my experience in engineering, most problems have relatively minor amounts of uncertainty (+- 30 to 60% at most).  Here it can be significantly more.  This calls for the need to understand large amounts of uncertainty.</p>

<p><strong>Principals of a Rigorous Morality:</strong> I believe that this way of thinking about morality and optimization leads us to the study and understanding of complex systems.  The tipping example can show us the beginnings of what may be described as a large “system” of assumptions and calculations.  The study of complex systems and networks has become quite popular in the last few decades and may help when structuring a system.
1. A graph-like structure.  A large system of fermi calculations (a relatively small one described in the tip example) can be seen to be made up of many similar structures or nodes.  In this case, we can say that a node represents a calculation, and a connection represents the use of the result of one calculation for another calculation.  Likewise we may be able to understand the structure of the system using a knowledge of graph theory and systems theory.
2. Heuristics (Simple outputs).  While a rigorous morality may be very complicated, it should be able to be interacted with in a relatively simple way.  A doctor may need years of medicine experience, but a patient should only need to know how to take a pill.  Likewise, a rigorous morality should be used to find take-aways and rules of thumb that can easily be applied to modern life.
3. Propagation of Uncertainty.  A rigorous morality would focus on the connections between different assumptions, each with different levels of uncertainty.  We can expect that this effectively will create “bottlenecks” whereby assumptions with high uncertainty mostly determine the uncertainty of the result.  Therefore it is important to focus on reducing uncertainty throughout a chain of assumptions such to minimize the uncertainty of the system, which is assumed to generally happen by focussing on the most uncertain elements of the system.  For example, if one has absolutely no idea how effective a nonprofit will be in existential risk reduction, most efforts to determine the exact amount of money saved by tipping will not be expected to improve the system’s decision.
4. Integration of intuitions.  A rigorous morality cannot be made up of only scientific data because most important assumptions in this field do not have scientific data.  Instead there will be situations where the most accurate expected answer is an intuitive one.  This may be a weighted sum of the intuitions of many people, and if so, that will need to be set up.    
5. Value of Information.  Most assumptions will not be worth modeling.  The time and effort that it takes to extend a rigorous morality should probably be decided on a basic of what is within the rigorous morality. For example, the tip example may not be worth spending much time on.  However, if I were to find out that every single person in the world would take my advice, I would spend more time on it (but there would be an ideal level of time to spend.)</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> A rigorous morality, as defined in this document, is expected to be very difficult to fully create.  It is expected that multiple revisions and lots of research and development will be necessary to create something really powerful.  However, I believe that it is definitely worth starting.  Rationality should win.</p>
