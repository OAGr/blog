    <div class="entry-content"><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Recently I spent some time researching Transparency, after preparing to write a few posts about it.  While originally I wanted to treat “Transparency” as a singular phenomena, the existing literature on it suggests that there really is no coherent idea of “Transparency”, but rather a set of several competing notions used in different fields<span class="certainty">~c1i3</span>.  For example, “Company Transparency” seems to refer a lot to having a nice company blog, while “Nonprofit Transparency” is often about the financials<span class="certainty">~c1i2</span>.  </p>

<p>This is what I have recorded from about one day of research on the topic.  I hope to look through some of the books and articles in more detail later on, this so far was just a broad overview. </p>

<p>I took these notes in a Workflowy <a href="https://workflowy.com/shared/de1355ef-35e1-7e27-cc34-8e48c4162d67/">here</a>, which I think is the easiest way to access (and contribute) to this<span class="certainty">~i2</span>.  However, I have also exported the notes below for convenience.  Fortunately the ‘export’ workflowy feature works very well with Markdown.</p>

              <li>“To head off such PR catastrophes, the authors recommend a policy of “transparency,” whereby companies disclose all possible information, a practice they feel boosts employee morale and performance, facilitates business partnerships, and helps responsible corporations attract socially conscious consumers and investors.”</li>
              <li>Seems to be a fairly generally good pop business book.  Good reviews (5/5 from 15 reviews on Amazon)</li>

              <li>My take: It gets some good reviews, some terrible ones.  Seems to me like an ‘open source is awesome’ promotion without much substance in the specific issues of what transparency is or how to implement it.</li>
              <li>Author seems to be quite a figure.  See this quote in his biography:
“ “…three Washington tours (counterintelligence, information technology, DCI’s vault for all technical systems), CIA Mid-Career Course, invited by Marine Corps to come back as a GS-14 to help created the Marine Corps Intelligence Center, did that. That was also my fork in the road. Discovered that the secret world is largely worthless in supporting all policy, all acquisition, all operations, and totally absent in supporting Whole of Government, public education, and public research. Started the modern Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) movement against very strong resistance from CIA, went on the train 7,500 mid-career officers from across 66+ countries, wrote the DIA, NATO, and SOF OSINT Handbooks. Created a for-profit (Open Source Solutions Network, now closed) and a non-profit (Earth Intelligence Network, 501c3, lying fallow). “</li>

          <li>Give the Emperor a Mirror: Toward Developing a Stakeholder Measurement of Organizational Transparency</li>
          <li>Abstract:
“The concept of organizational transparency has vaulted to prominence in recent years. While the virtues of transparency have been tied to trust and credibility, there have been no efforts to measure this abstract concept. Guidelines exist to help organizations be more transparent, but the real test is how stakeholders perceive an organization’s transparency. This paper focuses on developing a stakeholder measurement of organizational transparency. Factor analyses, structural equation models, and reliability alphas on the measurement items indicate the instrument measures three transparency reputation traits (integrity, respect for others, openness) and four transparency efforts (participation, substantial information, accountability, and secrecy).”</li>

            <ul>
              <li>The foundation stone of international norms for transparency was the 1923 International Convention Relating to the Simplification of Customs Formalities (“Customs Convention”).9 The Customs Convention established rules for transparency and review at the national level.10 All customs regulations were required to be promptly published “in such a manner as to enable persons concerned to become acquainted with them and to avoid the prejudice which might result from the application of customs formalities of which they are ignorant.”11 </li>

          <li>Summary: This was a short story of a CEO who blogged a lot followed by some discussion that “reputation online is everything.”  This is considered by him to be “Radical Transparency.”</li>
          <li>Quotes
            <ul>
              <li>“Nearly everyone I spoke to had a warning for would-be transparent CEOs: You can’t go halfway naked. It’s all or nothing. Executives who promise they’ll be open have to stay open. The minute they become evasive about troubling news, transparency’s implied social compact crumbles.”</li>
              <li>“The reputation economy creates an incentive to be more open, not less. Since Internet commentary is inescapable, the only way to influence it is to be part of it. Being transparent, opening up, posting interesting material frequently and often is the only way to amass positive links to yourself and thus to directly influence your Googleable reputation.”</li>

              <li>My take
                <ul>
                  <li>A very pretty report that rates a multinational companies on a few “transparency” questionnaires, specifically focussing on corruption.</li>
                  <li>The Questionnaire in some ways is the best part.  They have three indexes, each with a list of different questions.

                  <li>My take: It gets some good reviews, some terrible ones.  Seems to me like an ‘open source is awesome’ promotion without much substance in the specific issues of what transparency is or how to implement it.</li>
                  <li>Author seems to be quite a figure.  See this quote in his biography:
“ “…three Washington tours (counterintelligence, information technology, DCI’s vault for all technical systems), CIA Mid-Career Course, invited by Marine Corps to come back as a GS-14 to help created the Marine Corps Intelligence Center, did that. That was also my fork in the road. Discovered that the secret world is largely worthless in supporting all policy, all acquisition, all operations, and totally absent in supporting Whole of Government, public education, and public research. Started the modern Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) movement against very strong resistance from CIA, went on the train 7,500 mid-career officers from across 66+ countries, wrote the DIA, NATO, and SOF OSINT Handbooks. Created a for-profit (Open Source Solutions Network, now closed) and a non-profit (Earth Intelligence Network, 501c3, lying fallow). “</li>

Simply looking at other people isn’t enough to achieve this transparency, nor does looking seek to do so. - See more at: http://asymptotejournal.com/article.php?cat=Nonfiction&amp;id=23&amp;curr_index=0#sthash.eCkfKthK.dpuf”</li>

              <li>Abstract:
“The concept of organizational transparency has vaulted to prominence in recent years. While the virtues of transparency have been tied to trust and credibility, there have been no efforts to measure this abstract concept. Guidelines exist to help organizations be more transparent, but the real test is how stakeholders perceive an organization’s transparency. This paper focuses on developing a stakeholder measurement of organizational transparency. Factor analyses, structural equation models, and reliability alphas on the measurement items indicate the instrument measures three transparency reputation traits (integrity, respect for others, openness) and four transparency efforts (participation, substantial information, accountability, and secrecy).”</li>

              <li>Summary: This was a short story of a CEO who blogged a lot followed by some discussion that “reputation online is everything.”  This is considered by him to be “Radical Transparency.”</li>
              <li>Quotes
                <ul>
                  <li>“Nearly everyone I spoke to had a warning for would-be transparent CEOs: You can’t go halfway naked. It’s all or nothing. Executives who promise they’ll be open have to stay open. The minute they become evasive about troubling news, transparency’s implied social compact crumbles.”</li>
                  <li>“The reputation economy creates an incentive to be more open, not less. Since Internet commentary is inescapable, the only way to influence it is to be part of it. Being transparent, opening up, posting interesting material frequently and often is the only way to amass positive links to yourself and thus to directly influence your Googleable reputation.”</li>
