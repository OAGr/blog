    <h2 class="title">My Pomodoro Structure</h2>
    <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I’ve been getting back into the <a href="http://Pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro Technique</a>.  It was fun at first, then got to be to much, then I stopped, now I’m trying to continue at a basic level.</p>

<p>I started with <a href="http://mac.appstorm.net/reviews/productivity-review/tomatoes-full-featured-Pomodoro-time-managing-app/">Tomatoes</a>, a mac application that was highly recommended and seemed to do the most important Pomodoro necessities.  </p>

<p>I quickly found that I wanted to write notes on my actions, and the
application didn’t have any simple way of doing this.  I also wanted to
see if I could add other useful info, so I designed a Pomodoro sheet and
started using it.</p>

<p>While I’m all for web applications, paper is often far more flexible.  I
could imagine that there is the potential for web applications to truly
be flexible.  This is not yet the case, and not even being able to add
simple fields (notes, emotional level, etc.) to Pomodoros makes me feel
like existing tools are quite inadequate.  Perhaps I’ll eventually
attempt my own software solution, but for now I wanted to experiment
with what works for me on paper.</p>

<div style="max-width:50%">
  <p><img src="/assets/posts/pomodoro-itemsheet.jpg" alt="Pomodoro Rule Sheet" /></p>
</div>

<p>A day later after creating the first page, I realized that this sheet still didn’t give a good
breakdown on what I was doing throughout the day.  Sadly the App doesn’t
provide information into this either.  </p>

<p>To compensate I made another page for myself to scribble notes on about
my workload.  The segments that are shaded are the ones where I did
actual Pomodoros. I have used big numbers (low ones between 1-7) to
indicate which specific Pomodoro activities I was working on (labeled by
number on the first sheet).</p>

<p>This particularly felt frustrating because I do have lots of information
online with time stamps.  This includes git commits, documents, and my
work log on Hipchat.  Unfortunately I haven’t found any way of combining
this data to understand how I spend my time.  This is some of what I am
hoping to eventually achieve with <a href="http://feedhaven.com/">Feedhaven</a>,
assuming no one else makes something satisfactory first.</p>

<div style="max-width:50%">
  <p><img src="/assets/posts/pomodoro-timesheet.jpg" alt="Pomodoro Time Sheet" /></p>
</div>

<p>The idea was to have both of these sheets side by side. One big issue with this was that my desk isn’t really big enough to hold
on to the folder.  This, given the fact that I was using a small binder
which was clearly not designed for looking at both sides of a page, made
it very difficult to actually use this system in a practical sense.  It
feels strange in retrospect, but my work flow was limited by the length
of my working desk.</p>

<p>I did this for two days, then found that I lacked all will to continue
with the entire system during the weekend.  </p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/desk-setup.jpg" alt="Office Setup" /></p>

<p>Below is a summary of an approximation of the Pomodoros I have done each
day.  Note that over the last weekend (the 16th and 17th) it fell off
almost completely as I got really frustrated with the method.  Now I
will continue to use this mediocre software system, and will slowly wait
until I feel ready to go back into a more rigorous paper-software
combination again.  </p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/pomodoro-timeline.png" alt="Tomatoes Pomodoro App Worklog" /></p>

<p>Now I’ve temporarily put the paper system on hold, but am still doing
the application one.  I’ll definitely re-attempt the paper version soon,
but the most important thing for now is to at least keep on the Pomodoro
system in general.</p>
