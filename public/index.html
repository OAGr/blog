      <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Here at <a href="http://80000hours.org">80,000 Hours</a> we’re currently working to make a rubric to rate our research/blog quality.  My first step was to do a minor literature survey, and outline of which is given below.  You can also read and contribute to it on <a href="https://workflowy.com/shared/cb311015-0619-e9bc-9cb6-42ea79e9a2f1/">Workflowy</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>One of the main benefits of rubrics is for writing and learning, using them as a guideline, as opposed to only ranking things that have been done <span class="certainty">~c3</span>.  As such, a rubric could provide a lot of value to help us decide and find a consistent style of article <span class="certainty"> ~c1i1</span>.</li>
  <li>Often numbers are less important than written feedback, especially for improvement <span class="certainty">~c1i1</span>.</li>
  <li>It’s really important to have the “students” or “writers” help build the rubric <span class="certainty">~c1i1</span>.</li>
  <li>It’s possible to use rubric to decrease variance in scores.  However, it’s also possible that rubrics will increase variance in scores.  While there does not seem to be a ton of research in what kinds of rubrics improve precision, it seems like this should be considered and efforts should be made to make sure that the rubric is very clear <span class="certainty">~c1i1</span>.</li>

          </li>
          <li>Conclusions
            <ul>
              <li>This paper aimed to review empirical research and illuminate the questions of how the use of rubrics can (1) enhance the reliability of scoring, (2) facilitate valid judgment of performance assessments, and (3) give positive educational consequences, such as promoting learning and/or improve instruction.</li>
              <li>A first conclusion is that the reliable scoring of performance assessments can be enhanced by the use of rubrics. In relation to reliability issues, rubrics should be analytic, topic-specific, and complemented with exemplars and/or rater training. Since performance assessments are more or less open ended per definition, it is not always possible to restrict the assessment format to achieve high levels of reliability without sacrificing the validity.</li>
              <li>Another conclusion is that rubrics do not facilitate valid judgment of performance assessments per se. Valid assessment could be facilitated by using a more comprehensive framework of validity when validating the rubric, instead of focusing on only one or two aspects of validity. In relation to learning and instruction, consequential validity is an aspect of validity that might need further attention.</li>
              <li>Furthermore, it has been concluded that rubrics seem to have the potential of promoting learning and/or improve instruction. The main reason for this potential lies in the fact that rubrics make expectations and criteria explicit, which also facilitates feedback and self-assessment. It is thus argued that assessment quality criteria should emphasize dimensions like transparency and fitness for self-assessment to a greater extent than is done through the traditional reliability and validity criteria. This could be achieved through a framework of quality criteria that acknowledges the importance of trustworthiness in assessment as well as supports a more comprehensive view on validity issues (including educational consequences).</li>

        Transparency Research Outline

      <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Recently I spent some time researching Transparency, after preparing to write a few posts about it.  While originally I wanted to treat “Transparency” as a singular phenomena, the existing literature on it suggests that there really is no coherent idea of “Transparency”, but rather a set of several competing notions used in different fields<span class="certainty">~c1i3</span>.  For example, “Company Transparency” seems to refer a lot to having a nice company blog, while “Nonprofit Transparency” is often about the financials<span class="certainty">~c1i2</span>.  </p>

<p>This is what I have recorded from about one day of research on the topic.  I hope to look through some of the books and articles in more detail later on, this so far was just a broad overview. </p>

<p>I took these notes in a Workflowy <a href="https://workflowy.com/shared/de1355ef-35e1-7e27-cc34-8e48c4162d67/">here</a>, which I think is the easiest way to access (and contribute) to this<span class="certainty">~i2</span>.  However, I have also exported the notes below for convenience.  Fortunately the ‘export’ workflowy feature works very well with Markdown.</p>

              <li>My take: It gets some good reviews, some terrible ones.  Seems to me like an ‘open source is awesome’ promotion without much substance in the specific issues of what transparency is or how to implement it.</li>
              <li>Author seems to be quite a figure.  See this quote in his biography:
“ “…three Washington tours (counterintelligence, information technology, DCI’s vault for all technical systems), CIA Mid-Career Course, invited by Marine Corps to come back as a GS-14 to help created the Marine Corps Intelligence Center, did that. That was also my fork in the road. Discovered that the secret world is largely worthless in supporting all policy, all acquisition, all operations, and totally absent in supporting Whole of Government, public education, and public research. Started the modern Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) movement against very strong resistance from CIA, went on the train 7,500 mid-career officers from across 66+ countries, wrote the DIA, NATO, and SOF OSINT Handbooks. Created a for-profit (Open Source Solutions Network, now closed) and a non-profit (Earth Intelligence Network, 501c3, lying fallow). “</li>

          <li>Give the Emperor a Mirror: Toward Developing a Stakeholder Measurement of Organizational Transparency</li>
          <li>Abstract:
“The concept of organizational transparency has vaulted to prominence in recent years. While the virtues of transparency have been tied to trust and credibility, there have been no efforts to measure this abstract concept. Guidelines exist to help organizations be more transparent, but the real test is how stakeholders perceive an organization’s transparency. This paper focuses on developing a stakeholder measurement of organizational transparency. Factor analyses, structural equation models, and reliability alphas on the measurement items indicate the instrument measures three transparency reputation traits (integrity, respect for others, openness) and four transparency efforts (participation, substantial information, accountability, and secrecy).”</li>

              <li>The foundation stone of international norms for transparency was the 1923 International Convention Relating to the Simplification of Customs Formalities (“Customs Convention”).9 The Customs Convention established rules for transparency and review at the national level.10 All customs regulations were required to be promptly published “in such a manner as to enable persons concerned to become acquainted with them and to avoid the prejudice which might result from the application of customs formalities of which they are ignorant.”11 </li>

          <li>Summary: This was a short story of a CEO who blogged a lot followed by some discussion that “reputation online is everything.”  This is considered by him to be “Radical Transparency.”</li>
          <li>Quotes
            <ul>
              <li>“Nearly everyone I spoke to had a warning for would-be transparent CEOs: You can’t go halfway naked. It’s all or nothing. Executives who promise they’ll be open have to stay open. The minute they become evasive about troubling news, transparency’s implied social compact crumbles.”</li>
              <li>“The reputation economy creates an incentive to be more open, not less. Since Internet commentary is inescapable, the only way to influence it is to be part of it. Being transparent, opening up, posting interesting material frequently and often is the only way to amass positive links to yourself and thus to directly influence your Googleable reputation.”</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>A very pretty report that rates a multinational companies on a few “transparency” questionnaires, specifically focussing on corruption.</li>
                  <li>The Questionnaire in some ways is the best part.  They have three indexes, each with a list of different questions.

“ “…three Washington tours (counterintelligence, information technology, DCI’s vault for all technical systems), CIA Mid-Career Course, invited by Marine Corps to come back as a GS-14 to help created the Marine Corps Intelligence Center, did that. That was also my fork in the road. Discovered that the secret world is largely worthless in supporting all policy, all acquisition, all operations, and totally absent in supporting Whole of Government, public education, and public research. Started the modern Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) movement against very strong resistance from CIA, went on the train 7,500 mid-career officers from across 66+ countries, wrote the DIA, NATO, and SOF OSINT Handbooks. Created a for-profit (Open Source Solutions Network, now closed) and a non-profit (Earth Intelligence Network, 501c3, lying fallow). “</li>

              <li>Give the Emperor a Mirror: Toward Developing a Stakeholder Measurement of Organizational Transparency</li>
              <li>Abstract:
“The concept of organizational transparency has vaulted to prominence in recent years. While the virtues of transparency have been tied to trust and credibility, there have been no efforts to measure this abstract concept. Guidelines exist to help organizations be more transparent, but the real test is how stakeholders perceive an organization’s transparency. This paper focuses on developing a stakeholder measurement of organizational transparency. Factor analyses, structural equation models, and reliability alphas on the measurement items indicate the instrument measures three transparency reputation traits (integrity, respect for others, openness) and four transparency efforts (participation, substantial information, accountability, and secrecy).”</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>“Nearly everyone I spoke to had a warning for would-be transparent CEOs: You can’t go halfway naked. It’s all or nothing. Executives who promise they’ll be open have to stay open. The minute they become evasive about troubling news, transparency’s implied social compact crumbles.”</li>
                  <li>“The reputation economy creates an incentive to be more open, not less. Since Internet commentary is inescapable, the only way to influence it is to be part of it. Being transparent, opening up, posting interesting material frequently and often is the only way to amass positive links to yourself and thus to directly influence your Googleable reputation.”</li>

        Creating a Text Shorthand for Uncertainty
      </a>
    </h2>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>Most things I discuss are highly uncertain, but it can be really
confusing and wordy to state that uncertainty in writing.  In this last
sentence for example I felt the need to write “I find” to point out
uncertainty, for example.</p>

<p>First, people are really bad at agreeing on probabilities.  So if I say
something is “very certain”, that could mean 80% chance  to me and
95% chance to you.  This is rigorously explained in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Failure-Risk-Management-Broken-ebook/dp/B0026LTMAU/ref=la_B001JSJHIS_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1380144451&amp;sr=1-2">Failure
of Risk Management</a> (by the same author from How to Measure Anything), where it is explained further to say that this is especially true of risk managers.  </p>

<p>Second, there aren’t too many words to use to indicate uncertainty.  I
find that I need to repeat the same ones over and over again.  And when
they are used, these words can be quite wordy and confusing.   </p>

<ul>
  <li><em>I think</em> that</li>
  <li><em>In my opinion</em></li>
  <li>It <em>makes sense</em> that</li>
  <li>There aren’t <em>too</em> many things</li>
  <li><em>Perhaps,</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Several years ago some people made the language <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime">E-Prime</a> in large part
to make this uncertainty crystal clear.<br />
&gt;  E-Prime (short for English-Prime, sometimes denoted É or E′) is a prescriptive version of the English language that excludes all forms of the verb to be. E-Prime does not allow the conjugations of to be—be, am, is, are, was, were, been, being— the archaic forms of to be (e.g. art, wast, wert), or the contractions of to be—’s, ‘m, ‘re (e.g. I’m, he’s, she’s, they’re).<br />
Some scholars advocate using E-Prime as a device to clarify thinking and strengthen writing.[1] For example, the sentence “the film was good” could not be expressed under the rules of E-Prime, and the speaker might instead say “I liked the film” or “the film made me laugh”. The E-Prime versions communicate the speaker’s experience rather than judgment, making it harder for the writer or reader to confuse opinion with fact.</p>

<p>While I do intend to look more into E-prime, it seems like a bit much to
use on a regular level.</p>

<h2 id="a-possible-written-solution">A Possible (Written) Solution</h2>
<p>I propose that we instead use a symbol at the end of our sentences or
propositions to indicate uncertainty.  </p>

<h3 id="choosing-the-levels">Choosing the Levels</h3>
<p>A scale would have to be created of course in order to indicate what these levels are.  My guess
is that the optimal (for usefulness, popularity, and accuracy) amount of
levels would be around 5-10, especially because we aren’t very good at
accessing probability.  </p>

<p>Here’s one example that makes sense to me:<br />
0. ~50%
1. ~65%
2. ~80%
3. ~90%
4. ~95%
5. ~99.9%</p>

<p>In cases where something is <em>unlikely</em>, this would just work the
opposite way (50% to 0.01%).</p>

<h3 id="choosing-a-symbol">Choosing a Symbol</h3>
<p>I think that any representation of certainty would have to be achievable
with ASCII characters, if not the English keyboard.  Here are some
possibilities.  Each is shown to be representative for a level of 4/5,
according to a scale similar to what is shown above.</p>

<h4 id="non-numeric-forms">Non-Numeric forms</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The universe is expanding.’’’’</li>
  <li>The universe is expanding.&#8220;&#8220;</li>
  <li>The universe is expanding.`</li>
  <li>The universe is expanding. ····</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="numeric-forms">Numeric Forms</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The universe is expanding. `4</li>
  <li>The universe is expanding.4*</li>
  <li>The universe is expanding (~4).</li>
  <li>The universe is expanding (c~4).</li>
  <li>The universe is expanding (c4).</li>
  <li>The universe is expanding ~c4.</li>
  <li>The universe is expanding (?4).</li>
</ul>

<p>My personal favorite at this point is to have a number with the tilda
sign “~”, with a symbol for indication (like the “c” or “?”).  The dashes are be
difficult to read and more confusing to newcomers (c3).   </p>

<h2 id="different-kinds-of-uncertainty">Different Kinds of Uncertainty</h2>
<p>So far we’ve assumed that the definition of ‘uncertainty’ is relatively
clear, but sometimes there are different definitions of uncertainty.</p>

<p>For instance, there’s the certainty of “the existing scientific
literature strongly agrees that evolution is true”, and the certainty of
“I personally am very certain that the Paleo diet is good, even though
others might disagree.”  </p>

<p>These could be indicated by different symbols.  This would require a
small dictionary of symbols/standards, but this may not be very
unreasonable.</p>

<p>Say we use ‘c’ to indicate ‘consensus’ and ‘i’ to indicate ‘personal
intuition’, and ‘r’ to indicate ‘personal research/rationality’.  Not
all of these would need to be used in every instance, only the ones that
are instantially relevant. </p>

<p>Some statements could be as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The universe is expanding ~c5.  </li>
  <li>I’m not likely to do well in finance ~i4c1r2.  </li>
  <li>Polyphasic sleep has a lot of potential ~r4c1.</li>
  <li>I was a poor math student ~i4r2 in high school, but have learned a lot
~i3r2 since then.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, we’d need a definition for this, which is effectively a
standard.  For now I’ll call it “Uncertainty Notation V0.1”  I’ll try it
out in future posts as an experiment.

<h3 id="blog-statistics">Blog Statistics</h3>
<p>I believe that this blog post took me approximately 4-7 hours to write,
plus another 2-10 hours to discuss / brainstorm on.  Of course, much of
that resulted in other thoughts that have not yet been put into this
post.</p>

        Cost Benefit Analysis of Blogging
      </a>
    </h2>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>Recently I’ve written a short stream of short posts.  They take quite a
while (2-8 Pomodoros each), so I’ve been trying to figure out how useful
they really are.  Here are some costs and benefits I’ve come up with.  I
realize that typically only a few will carry the vast majority of the
importance (see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto Principle</a>) so have indicated my impressions of the importance of each one.</p>

<h3 id="benefits">Benefits</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Idea Dissemination (Important)</strong><br />
Take my ideas from inside my head and provide
them for the world!  The obvious reason for blogging.  Can be somewhat
measured by tracking visitors, reading comments, and talking to readers.   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Online Credibility (Important)</strong><br />
I find that reading someone’s blog is one of the best ways to know
them, particularly if they are an introvert.  Blogging is a good way to
show others that you’re generally thoughtful and intelligent.  </p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Experience Writing (Slightly Important)</strong><br />
Writing is a useful skill to have, and practice makes one better.
With blogs there is some feedback as well as a clear incentive to
improve.  Blog writing seems quite similar to book writing and report
writing, which are two fields that a lot of important people seem to
need.<br />
I could probably improve this a lot by focussing in on each of the
following.
    <ul>
      <li>Quality<br />
  If I’m spending 4 hours writing a post, it may make sense to
spend $5-$20 (oDesk perhaps) on an editor, mainly for the feedback to improve it.  This
may also take another 1-3 hours per post.
  I assume I could measure quality improvement by going back to my
old essays and seeing if they are obviously worse.  If not, perhaps I
haven’t improved.</li>
      <li>Speed<br />
  Recently I have been measuring the number of Pomodoros my
writing has taken me.  I’ll try to post future numbers along with
future posts.    </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Idea Generation (Very Important)</strong><br />
Writing blog posts forces me to lay out my ideas and ideate on them
enough to produce something somewhat coherent.  This may be the most
valuable aspect, now that I reflect on this.  My reports/longer posts
have forced me to do analysis and reference external materials.<br />
I imagine I could measure this a bit by looking back and judging how
much of my current thought process is directly because of research from
my previous blog posts.  This may be quite considerable.</li>
  <li><strong>Personal Reference (Very Slightly Important)</strong><br />
I would like to keep track of what I know.  I could somewhat measure
this by keeping track of how often I actually go back to read previous
material.  So far the answer is not often for the vast majority, but
occationally for the most important papers.  Much of the reference seems
only useful so far as for me to see if I’m improving as a writer, for
reasons mentioned above.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="costs">Costs</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Time to Write (Opportunity Cost) (Important)</strong><br />
My work flow with Octopress is somewhat complicated, and as of now it
takes me at least 2 Pomodoros (one hour of intense concentration) to
write a small post.  My previous on on the Epistemologies of Effective
Altruist Groups took me a good 4-6 hours to write, effectively the most
productive part of my Saturday.  I stopped tracking Pomodoros for a
while as I started grinding (this is normally a bad idea in my
experience).  This definitely was far more than I was expecting and I
could have gotten a lot of work done for 80,000 Hours in that time.<br />
I estimate that so far my blog (this specific one, not my old one) has
taken me about 20 hours to set up and about 15 hours to write on (around
7 posts in that time).  If my time is worth $50 an hour, that means that
this cost me almost $2k so far.  I’m currently very low on money so this
is a lot to me.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Time to Socialize (Opportunity Cost) (Important)</strong><br />
I split this up for transparency and because it’s not very obvious.  I
find that so far for each blog post I write, I tend to spend at least
30 minutes to 2 hours checking &amp; replying to comments, seeing Facebook
likes, and looking at Google Analytics.  I could reduce this with
discipline.  One reason why I’m worried about changing to LessWrong is
that I may spend a lot of time replying to comments there (it would seem
rude not to).  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Attention (Not Very Important)</strong><br />
When I’ve been blogging I’ve noticed that I’ve thought a lot about new
topics.  This attention is incredibly hard to quantify.  I expect it
isn’t too important to consider here, because these seem like good
things for me to come up with anyway.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This post took me approximately 3.5 Pomodoros to write and publish
While writing it I started 2 other blog posts which I would like to soon
finish (one of which took another 0.5 Pomodoros). This post is around 900 words, so this results in around 250 words per Pomodoro, or 10 words per minute.) One of these new blog posts includes
details on my existing blog traffic to provide insight to some of the
above.  I would love to write a rigorous analysis of each, but it would
take quite a long time. </p>

        Navigating the Epistemologies of Effective Altruism
      </a>
    </h2>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>A few months ago I was with several members of the effective altruism
community on a video chat about how to compare different effective
altruism groups.  Someone recommended that we try to have a
meta-evaluation to rank them, but on some further discussion it became
apparent that that would be incredibly difficult to do.  </p>

<p>The different organizations just don’t have the same goals as
each other.  Many were “effective” within their own
standard of epistemology, but not in those of the others.  So comparing them was more about comparing general epistemologies
then doing direct comparisons of the organizations themselves.</p>

<p>Here is my current attempt at making some sense of the “main” effective altruist
groups, based on their disagreements on epistemology.  </p>

<h2 id="charity-evaluators">Charity Evaluators</h2>

<p>It makes sense to begin with <strong><a href="http://givewell.org/">Givewell</a></strong>, because they seem to be the first and most recognized group within Effective Altruism.  Upon launch in 2007 they promoted the idea that charities could be
evaluated on the efficiency of money put in to the amount of “good”
outputted.  This was backed up with research by the GiveWell team to
identify and recognize the “most efficient” charities.  This made a lot
of sense to many smart people, but soon things became quite complicated
as groups also trying to “do the most good” within charity evaluation
emerged to somewhat compete with them.</p>

<p>GiveWell is reluctant to investigate animal welfare charities, seemingly
because its founders value animals <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2010/12/27/animal-welfare-charities/">substantially less than humans</a>.  Other people have decided that animals are worth more in respect to humans than Givewell has indicated, and some of these have set up a “GiveWell for Animals”, or <strong><a href="http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org/Evaluation">Effective Animal Activism</a></strong>.  <strong>Aidgrade</strong> was established a semi-Givewell competitor and disagrees with them about the <a href="http://www.aidgrade.org/uncategorized/some-friendly-concerns-with-givewell">proper methods to do charity evaluations</a>.</p>

<h2 id="effective-altruism-funders">Effective Altruism Funders</h2>
<p>Then come the more somewhat high-risk meta-charities that promote
giving to Effective Altruist groups, like <strong>Giving What We Can</strong>, <strong>The
Life You Can Save</strong>, and <strong>80,000 Hours</strong>.  These groups are really interesting to me
because on paper what they’re doing seems to be working (Giving What We
Can has estimated to be able to encourage the giving of around <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/getting-involved/donate">$8 for
every $1 donated to them</a>, for instance).  </p>

<p>Yet from what I understand, GiveWell refuses to recommend any of these as top charities.  My
impression is that GiveWell finds it highly unlikely that any of these
organizations are as effective  as their recommended
charities.  Of course, many of these organizations exist on the
assumption that they are.  This area seems particularly awkward as all of these
meta-charities promote GiveWell publicly, leading to <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-09-08/a-conversation-with-holden-karnofsky-co-founder-of-givewell-part-ii">several</a> <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/172-interview-with-holden-karnofsky-co-founder-of-givewell">interviews</a>.  I imagine that it’s better off for everyone that Givewell and CEA appear as close friends, yet internally it seems like there’s a bit of tension over this stark disagreement on the need for CEA’s existence.  This disagreement is somewhat showcased in the comments <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/254-case-study-designing-a-new-organisation-that-might-be-more-effective-than-givewell-s-top-recommendation">here</a>.  </p>

<p>Also of note here is <strong><a href="http://www.effectivefundraising.net/">Effective Fundraising</a></strong>.  This group is directly writing grants for both the AMF (GiveWell’s top choice) and the Humane League (Effective Animal Activism’s top choice).  They’ve discussed why they split between them <a href="http://www.effectivefundraising.net/1/post/2013/08/how-we-select-our-charities.html">here</a>.  80,000 Hours and CEA have interviewed them and written a blog post with a very nice name and slightly less praising contents.  There’s a bit of back and forth between them in the <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/254-case-study-designing-the-world-s-most-effective-charity">comments</a>, which I referred to earlier.</p>

<h2 id="ai-risk-and-far-future-researchers">AI Risk and Far Future Researchers</h2>
<p>Going further, when coming to the topic of AI risk, things get much more
confusing.  Organizations like <strong><a href="http://intelligence.org/">MIRI</a></strong> and
<strong><a href="http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/">FHI</a></strong> claim that AI risk and other existential
risks are by far the most important causes.  Holden of Givewell wrote a
very long critique <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/cbs/thoughts_on_the_singularity_institute_si/">here</a>, which there’s since been quite a bit of debate about.  I suspect that incredibly few people actually have a deep understanding of the efficiencies or even importance of donating to prevent AI risk, and it is quite apparent that most donating will have to go with either a gut feeling or choose based on which social group they trust more.  </p>

<p>Brian Tomasik has been a very interesting and rather independent thinker
within the movement, known for his series of <a href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/">Utilitarian Essays</a>. Even more than animal causes, he has numbers to recommend donating for <a href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/humane-insecticides.html">insect causes</a> that make it seem like a fantastic area for efficient intervention.  The main argument I’ve heard from others against insect causes is that they seem intuitively silly, not that they aren’t actually effective.  </p>

<p>Recently Brian has made his own research institute called <strong><a href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/where-i-recommend-donating.html">FRI</a></strong> to focus on long term suffering reduction.  Sure enough it’s his number 1 recommended charity, but more surprisingly to me is that the number 2 isn’t another similar far-future venture like MIRI or FHI, but instead <a href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/where-i-recommend-donating.html">Animal Ethics</a>.  I suppose he’s both very concerned with the far future, but not very concerned with AI risk (the main reason he wouldn’t recommend MIRI or FHI).</p>

<p>Another organization that comes to my mind is <strong>Leverage Research</strong>.  I’m not sure
what category to put them in because they seem to be trying to do a bit
of everything.  However, I would point out that they appear to be the
polar opposites of GiveWell regarding to belief in transparency, with all of the
other organizations mentioned above are somewhat in between (with the
possible exception of Effective Fundraising).  My belief is that their
expected method of doing the most good involves having a few smart
people spend several years 
thinking about “big issues”, without much care for outsider input
(you’ll notice a lack of much information on their <a href="http://www.leverageresearch.org/">website</a>).  These research topics seem to be more psychological and social than
AI-risk, from what I understand.  Most other EA organizations seem very skeptical of their research posted so far,
mainly <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/el9/a_critique_of_leverage_researchs_connection_theory/">Connection Theory</a>.  However, a few people within Leverage run <a href="http://www.thehighimpactnetwork.org/">Think!</a>, and they have created the <a href="http://www.effectivealtruismsummit.com/">Effective Altruist Summit</a>, which has gotten good reviews.</p>

<h2 id="future-organizations">Future Organizations</h2>

<p>I really hope that the issue of correct epistemology gets resolved and
more of these organizations can at least agree on some standard ways of
Effective Altruist Organization evaluation.  But it seems unlikely to
happen anytime soon.</p>

<p>The current trend from my point of view seems to be that every other new
prominent Effective Altruist thinker will create a new organization to
match another unique epistemology.  I really hope that we don’t get
stuck with 20 different Charity Evaluators of slightly differing
standards and 50 funding groups that randomly give to selections from
those different evaluators, and another 10 Far Future groups that will
emphasize slightly different things because of unique epistemological
reasons.  But given the fact that there is so much disagreement within
what seems like such a small and intelligent group already, I could
definitely see things going this way.</p>

<p>Granted, this still is a lot better than what is the global cultural
norm right now.  I would expect that most of the groups above average
are far more useful than the global human average.  But the global norm
is pathetically low, so that shouldn’t be considered too important.
Within these groups, I’d expect that many consider order of magnitude
differences between them, so internal fragmentation may cause quite a bit
of damage.  And it’s definitely confusing as anything to a newcomer who
just wants to be an “Efficient Altruist”.</p>

<h3 id="personal-bias">Personal Bias</h3>
<p>I should point out that I know people from most of the organizations
mentioned, so probably am quite biased.  I am presently
working at 80,000 Hours, which is based in the same office as Giving
What we Can, The Center For Effective Altruism, and The Future of Humanity
Institute.  Recently I applied to and was rejected from
working at Leverage Research.</p>

<h3 id="blog-efficiency">Blog Efficiency</h3>
<p>This post took me about 5 hours to write. I ended up splitting my
thoughts into two posts (leaving the rest for one more to come shortly).
I’ve tracked 4 Pomodoros in this time, but then I just kept on
working for a few hours without tracking.  I originally intended for
this to be about 2 Pomodoros, but this was for a small comment about
“Epistemology as a Deus Ex Machina” rather than a small EA Org overview.  </p>

<p>My guess is that I’ll dedicate at least another hour or two to checking
stats of readership for this post and/or reading/responding to comments.</p>

        Effective Altruism Is Open Territory
      </a>
    </h2>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>Academic disciplines sometimes start with bangs.  A few initial ideas
lead to a flurry of innovation which lasts until the field is either
split off into sub disciplines (psychology, cybernetics), or becomes
mostly irrelevant.  </p>

<p>I think that Effective Altruism may be an academic discipline waiting to
emerge. It seems like there are some incredibly fundamental problems in
the field that have barely had any thought put into them.  This includes
questions like should donations happen now vs. later, or what
flow-through effects are like, or understanding if the average software
engineer creates more value writing software or donating their salary.</p>

<p>Once some headway is made, questions like these could lead to much
larger fields.  Judging on the history
of science, the discoverers will be remembered, even if many
of their insights were inevitable.  From a fame and perceived influence
perspective, Effective Altruism seems like a good field to study.  </p>

<h3 id="who-will-do-the-research">Who will do the research?</h3>

<p>The ironic thing is that most people able to research
Effective Altruism seem to be choosing against it because it itself may
not be effective to research.  Many of the most prominent EA bloggers
have other careers and only think and write on this in their spare time.  I think that researching Effective 
Altruism itself has barely been considered to be an Effective Altruist
career possibility at all within the movement, unless its directly related to the efforts of a specific organization like Givewell or 80,000 Hours.  It seems quite possible that even within this open
territory, incredibly little progress will be made any time soon.</p>

<p>Another possibility is that some non-effective altruists would study
Effective Altruism.  Perhaps counter-factually this may
a rather nice outcome, though the discipline figureheads would all be
very strange representatives.  While this could be interesting, it seems
exceedingly unlikely, as it would be expected to be difficult to
research something one doesn’t believe in.  However, given the amazing
flexibility it seems like we’ve seen in adherence to strict optimization
within the community, I’m sure there will be a few members to
compromise, even if the math doesn’t work out.</p>

<h3 id="when-will-effective-altruism-research-be-effective">When will Effective Altruism Research be Effective?</h3>
<p>The success of Effective Altruism research will very much depend on the
acceptance of Effective Altruism among people making important decisions
(either lots of people making minor decisions or a few people making
very important ones).  If this doesn’t happen, even a perfect model of
how to optimize one’s life for humanity wouldn’t have any non-academic
weight.  </p>

<p>So perhaps much research into this field is a gamble in the future
public interest in it, as there’s definitely not much now.  My guess is
that if the movement starts becoming significantly more popular,
researchers will begin flooding in realizing the sense of the
opportunity.  Of course, it may be much more difficult for the movement
to become much more popular without significant research on its side.
Right now organizations like 80,000 Hours are making recommendations,
but detractors are somewhat right when they point out that 80,000 Hours
doesn’t have much evidence or research to advice with.</p>

<p>In this system, the current default of employed people doing this in
their free time may be a good idea for now.  If we have a lot of hobbyists
figuring out the basics and promoting them, it may only be a matter of
time until the snowball rolls far enough for people to get serious about the discipline.  When they do, I suspect things will get <em>very</em> interesting.</p>

      <a href="/blog/2013/09/19/should-more-nonprofits-fail/">
        
        Should More Effective Altruist Organizations Fail?
      </a>
    </h2>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p><a href="http://ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a> is about <em>the</em> most successful business
incubator to date.  It’s hatched 37 companies with worth or sold for
over $40 million in its’ few years of life, and has an acceptance rate
of less than 6%.  However, almost all of these companies fail.  As
<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/startup-odds-of-success-2013-5#ixzz2V5fDO1Nd">Business Insider</a> points out,<strong>“93% of the companies that get accepted by Y Combinator eventually fail”</strong>.</p>

<p>Though this is agnowledged as an unfortunate hurdle, it’s also widely
believed that quite a bit of business failure is healthy to markets.
Poor ideas and implementations get weeded out for better ones, and in
the end the winners typically are quite a bit better than average.
International capitalism is very harsh but results in quality products.</p>

<p>It would seem to me like the bar for Effective Altruist organizations is
significantly higher in many ways than for these businesses.  That is
not because it’s difficult to fundraise, but because it’s difficult to
be effective.  </p>

<p>I want to clarify on the demands of an organization that itself is
“Effective” in the “Effective Altruist” sense.  An “effective” organization 
here is one where the world is better off with it in existance than if
the counterfactual resources required were used for the “next” best
utilitarian cause.  A lower bound for this should be if all of the
organizational employees earned to give in their highest paying jobs
possible, and all of the resulting money, with that from organizational
donors, would go to the AMF instead.</p>

<p>So for example, if a 5-person division receiving $100,000 per year
 were “effective”, it would mean that it is doing
more good than if all 5 people would have instead gone to work and
donated that money (say $20,000 each per person per year), plus that
$100,000 all would have gone to save the AMF.  This is a really tough
requirement given the efficiency of the AMF, but is what some of these
groups claim.</p>

<p>Creating a charity or finding any cause more efficient than the <a href="http://www.againstmalaria.com/">Against
Malaria Foundation</a> is just incredibly difficult.  I’m quite sure that
when the AMF was starting it couldn’t have expected to reach the
efficiencies and successes that it had.  One reason for this is that
Givewell gets to cherry pick the most efficient outcomes rather than the
best plans, and it seems like these would fall on the end of the
gaussian curve of luck as well as skill.</p>

<p>This isn’t to say that it’s a poor idea to create an Effective Altruist
organization, in the same way that it’s not a particularly poor idea to
create a business knowing the poor success rates.  It may be with the
right idea you can expect a reasonable expected value, even given the
chance of failure.  </p>

<p>What it does mean is that I would expect that organizations attempting Effective Altruism <em>should be failing.</em>  I’m not sure how many, but 90% wouldn’t intuitively seem unreasonable to me given that’s the bar for what I would assume an easier goal (business success as a Y-Combinator acceptee).  </p>

<p>But looking back, have any failed?  Have any groups in this area really
admitted failure after looking at some difficult metrics?</p>

<p>Some possible groups in this area that may be “Effective Altruist” that
come to my mind are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Givewell</li>
  <li>The Future of Humanity Institute</li>
  <li>Effective Animal Altruism</li>
  <li>Effective Fundraising</li>
  <li>Aidgrade</li>
  <li>80,000 Hours</li>
  <li>Giving What We Can</li>
  <li>The Life You Can Save</li>
  <li>The Machine Intelligence Research Institute</li>
  <li>The Center for Applied Rationality</li>
  <li>Leverage Research</li>
  <li>Think! Network</li>
</ul>

<p>One alternative may be to imagine that we are in a gold rush where there
is so much unexplored area in this domain that almost each new venture
succeeds.  If this were true I would think that there should be a lot
new EA organizations until this stops being the case.</p>

<p>Another alternative explanation is that many of these groups aren’t
actually “Effective” in the “Effective Altruist” sense, and don’t care
to be.  Or that there are so many definitions of “Effective Altruist”
that each organization gets to pick their own specific one.  </p>

        My Productivity Failure Loop
      </a>
    </h2>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>I’ve tried structured methods (Getting Things Done, Task Management
Systems, the Kanban Method, Polyphasic Sleep, Pomodoro) several times and almost each time so far has ended
in abysmal failure.  </p>

<p>It’s surprisingly alarming because each time I seem to go through the
same exact pattern.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Read a small bit about a project management method, become intrigued.</li>
  <li>Start using it to it’s most basic extent.</li>
  <li>Enjoy the gains, but desire to become much better.</li>
  <li>Read extensively on it and try to go substantially further.</li>
  <li>Get tired of the increased structure workload and give up completely.</li>
  <li>Be satisfied with the new productivity gains from having no
structure.</li>
  <li>Feel too incompetent to attempt other management tools in the near
future.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is a terrible failure mode and I’m trying my best to not keep on
this cycle of spaced mediocrity.  </p>

<h3 id="possible-solutions">Possible Solutions</h3>
<p>The only ways out of this that I can tell are:  </p>

<ol>
  <li>Maintain one basic state of management for an extended period (30
days) before reaching any further.  </li>
  <li>Forcing myself to retreat to a previous position rather than give up
completely, post wear-out.</li>
</ol>

<p>Right now I’ve chosen option 2, because option 1 seems far too slow.  </p>

<h3 id="existing-dilemma">Existing Dilemma</h3>
<p>Last week I’ve started working on Pomodoros and sure enough, my system
quickly got out of hand.  I started with an online tracker, then
extended that to a printed page, then extended that to two printed pages
(one to manage tasks and the other to manage time), and then stopped
completely over the weekend.  </p>

<p>Now I’m trying again, but with just one page and the time tracker app.
I’ll pre-commit here for more public pressure, and let people know once
I hit 30 days.  </p>

        My Pomodoro Structure
      </a>
    </h2>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>Recently I’ve been getting back into the <a href="http://Pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro Technique</a>.  It was fun at first, then got to be to much, then I stopped, now I’m trying to continue at a basic level.</p>

<p>I started with <a href="http://mac.appstorm.net/reviews/productivity-review/tomatoes-full-featured-Pomodoro-time-managing-app/">Tomatoes</a>, a mac application that was highly recommended and seemed to do the most important Pomodoro necessities.  </p>

<p>I quickly found that I wanted to write notes on my actions, and the
application didn’t have any simple way of doing this.  I also wanted to
see if I could add other useful info, so I designed a Pomodoro sheet and
started using it.</p>

<p>While I’m all for web applications, paper is often far more flexible.  I
could imagine that there is the potential for web applications to truly
be flexible.  This is not yet the case, and not even being able to add
simple fields (notes, emotional level, etc.) to Pomodoros makes me feel
like existing tools are quite inadequate.  Perhaps I’ll eventually
attempt my own software solution, but for now I wanted to experiment
with what works for me on paper.</p>

<div style="max-width:50%">
  <p><img src="/assets/posts/pomodoro-itemsheet.jpg" alt="Pomodoro Rule Sheet" /></p>
</div>

<p>A day later after creating the first page, I realized that this sheet still didn’t give a good
breakdown on what I was doing throughout the day.  Sadly the App doesn’t
provide information into this either.  </p>

<p>To compensate I made another page for myself to scribble notes on about
my workload.  The segments that are shaded are the ones where I did
actual Pomodoros. I have used big numbers (low ones between 1-7) to
indicate which specific Pomodoro activities I was working on (labeled by
number on the first sheet).</p>

<p>This particularly felt frustrating because I do have lots of information
online with time stamps.  This includes git commits, documents, and my
work log on Hipchat.  Unfortunately I haven’t found any way of combining
this data to understand how I spend my time.  This is some of what I am
hoping to eventually achieve with <a href="http://feedhaven.com/">Feedhaven</a>,
assuming no one else makes something satisfactory first.</p>

<div style="max-width:50%">
  <p><img src="/assets/posts/pomodoro-timesheet.jpg" alt="Pomodoro Time Sheet" /></p>

<p>The idea was to have both of these sheets side by side. One big issue with this was that my desk isn’t really big enough to hold
on to the folder.  This, given the fact that I was using a small binder
which was clearly not designed for looking at both sides of a page, made
it very difficult to actually use this system in a practical sense.  It
feels strange in retrospect, but my work flow was limited by the length
of my working desk.</p>

<p>I did this for two days, then found that I lacked all will to continue
with the entire system during the weekend.  </p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/desk-setup.jpg" alt="Office Setup" /></p>

<p>Below is a summary of an approximation of the Pomodoros I have done each
day.  Note that over the last weekend (the 16th and 17th) it fell off
almost completely as I got really frustrated with the method.  Now I
will continue to use this mediocre software system, and will slowly wait
until I feel ready to go back into a more rigorous paper-software
combination again.  </p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/pomodoro-timeline.png" alt="Tomatoes Pomodoro App Worklog" /></p>

<p>Now I’ve temporarily put the paper system on hold, but am still doing
the application one.  I’ll definitely re-attempt the paper version soon,
but the most important thing for now is to at least keep on the Pomodoro
system in general.</p>

B: “Maybe so, but it’s been shown statistically that networking events lead to lower happiness levels”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m quite familiar with conversations like the one above.  While most aren’t as long as this, it should be quite apparent that none of the reasons mentioned is the real decision factor.  More argument would lead to more rationalizations, but when discussed in this way it would appear that the primary (and quite possibly the only) reason for not attending the event is hidden from the receiver.  </p>

<p>This could be either an explicit lie, or an internal rationalization.  Either way can be very frustrating, but I belive the second is far more common and dangerous.</p>

<p>I believe it’s been shown in studies (very sorry for not linking to one, I can’t seem to find it at the moment) that when people make opinions and decisions, they often make intutive judgements immiately and follow them up with long lists of logical reasons to back that up.  This means that the reasons given aren’t exactly why the person believes that at all.  And thus, if one were to make fantastic arguments against each, the belief wouldn’t necessarilly change. </p>

<p>I’ll refer to these “unimportant” arguments as <strong>post-decision arguments</strong>, to help point out that they get made after a decision has already been reached, and thus have had no role in the decision making process.  Thus, any work countering a post-decision argument is only useful insofar as to get someone to admit a pre-decision argument, which often will never happen.</p>

<p>The scary thing is that these people have no idea that this is happening.  We <em>think</em> we make decisions based on explicit reasons, but normally don’t do so at all.  Instead we make up these strange arguments to support our instant thought processes.  And then spend dozens of hours of debate on points that aren’t even decision-relevant in the first place.</p>

<p>This would be particularly terrible if our intuitive process worked poorly.  And sometimes it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias">does</a>, but normally it’s able to get us through the day surprisingly well.    </p>

<p>The best thing we can do is to recognize these areas and agnowledge them.  For whatever reason, “rationalization” seems to be a very touchy and misunderstood word for this sort of thing.  So rather than use “rationalization” as a word for a single argument, I prefer the term “<em>shadow zone</em>” as the space of all arguments made post-decision.  So instead of thinking “Is that argument a rationalization or a realistic reason?” we could ask “are we in the <em>shadow zone</em>?”</p>

<p>The <em>shadow zone</em> is named as to imply a space that no one really understands and that everyone finds quite murkey and mysterious.  Which is exactly what many of these post-decision arguments are.  The fact that they weren’t used to make a decision implies that they haven’t been thought out but instead were chosen to <em>feel</em> satisfactory.  Ideally these arguments would come with big <strong>warning!</strong> signs attached, but until the Google Glass gets that functionality we’ll have to do with clever names.  </p>

        Goal Factoring: Silent Meeting Attendees

    </h2>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>You know all of those people hanging around during a discussion while 1-3 people debate something? I think they’re likely a sign that something is wrong. Let’s look at the benefits and costs of having non-speaking entities in a meeting or discussion. </p>

<h2 id="possible-benefits">Possible Benefits:</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Learning from watching</strong><br />
 This may be improved with a video.  Unlike human discussions, videos can be sped up, skipped, and played whenever convenient.  I also suspect that there is a high correlation between participation and understanding, so I assume that many people not participating are not understanding much anyway.</li>
  <li><strong>Possibilities of comments</strong><br />
 How useful have these spare comments actually been in the past, specifically those that can’t be emailed to a specific party?  Online chat systems can target questions and comments far more efficiently than meeting situations can.</li>
  <li><strong>Support for the speakers</strong><br />
 If speakers just want to feel appreciated, then purchase inexpensive virtual assistants to attend in the place of useful employees.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="possible-harms-besides-obvious-opportunity-costs">Possible Harms (besides obvious opportunity costs):</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Reduction of energy</strong><br />
 When I’m bored I loose energy and wind up more exhausted than I would have been accomplishing useful work.  Paying half-attention and doing nothing actively reduces the quality of my life.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Culture of meetings and slow time encouraged</strong>  </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>That is all.  I encourage small meetings, and when discussions begin with a subset, either they agree to talk separately or it’s ok-ed for the others to leave.</p>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>For a while I’ve been considering the costs of putting together large numbers of people.  The cost scales roughly linearly, but sometimes it’s difficult to remember that.  Putting together a mediocre presentation for 3 people is almost exactly half as bad as putting together one for 6 people.  And when it’s for a few hundred, you should seriously be on top of your content. As a really simple demonstration, I’ve put together a small table.  The columns represent the hourly value of the average person in attendance.  The rows represent the number of people in attendance.

<p>So if you have a meeting of 10 people whose time is worth $300 per hour (not salary but value), then by taking 5 minutes to set up, you are wasting $250.00 ($50.00 * 5).  A wasted 1-hour meeting of that size could have <a href="http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF">saved a kid from malaria</a>. There are quite a few other articles on this subject.  They seem to focus on business meetings and making sure they go well.  One detail that they use that may not apply far outside is a reliance on using employee salary as a proxy for the cost of an employee’s time.  This seems like a poor metric where there is much producer surplus, as employee replaceability is not trivial and employee value is much higher than the salary (if it’s lower, they should be fired).  The fact that business articles seem to use this measure indicates that they don’t often attempt to calculate an employee’s value per hour, which seems like a larger error than not quantifying meetings. For nonprofits and small organizations this can be especially true.  For a nonprofit to be effective (in the effective altruist term), individual hourly value must be at least as much as a company salary for that person.  Else the individual could just work at a company and donate that amount to the nonprofit.  So either the hourly value is quite high, or the nonprofit is ineffective.  Startups are paid with equity with terms not incredibly correlated to their working hours, so would also have to adjust their hourly rate in a way that makes sense to the company.</p>

<h2 id="protection-measures">Protection Measures</h2>

<p><img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/burning-money.jpg" alt="Burning-Money" class="center" /> </p>

<p>As a bit of a dramatic action, one can imagine destroying X money every minute during a meeting, to remind people how urgent it is and make sure they don’t waste time.  Deciding the optimal amount of X is an interesting thought experiment. Imagine that a meeting is costing $500 per hour.  If destroying half of that in physical items would lead to a shortening of the meeting by 1/2, then it would be net neutral. Meeting Cost = Time + Money Destroyed = (cost/min) * (60 - f(d)) + d Here cost/min refers to the cost of the meeting per minute as shown in the article above.  60 refers to 60 minutes, assuming a 1 hour meeting.  f(d) is a function based on d from which the time would be reduced by, and d is the money destroyed. While I won’t attempt to model this, I would imagine that destroying somewhere between 1/3rd to 1/10th of the money wasted could be an efficient use of your money.  So for example, at the next meeting one has with 20 high profile people in the audience, you may want one person in a very visible place burn or rip up about $10-$30 each minute, to remind people to keep it short and important.  Or you may want to dramatically destroy an object worth as much if it makes the point better.</p>

<h2 id="lectures--presentations">Lectures &amp; Presentations</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/lecture.png" alt="lecture-hall" /><br />
If we value our student’s time at $40 per hour, then a 1-hour lecture with 200 students costs $8,000 of student’s time.  You could destroy a 50-inch TV or 1/4th that cost (maybe do it pieces throughout?)  At what point in the teacher’s preparation would the marginal benefit of them preparing more actually be less than that of the student’s time?  It would obviously be somewhere, but probably quite late, especially if material would be re-used later. This is one thing that makes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MOOCs</a> so awesome.  With even a small optimization on traditional lecturers, the totaled value may be gigantic.  Lectures are something that deserve large optimization because they are incredibly expensive, the only issue is that the expenses aren’t obviously apparent nor are incurred on the parties responsible for them. Likewise, large public presentations should be optimized for similar reasons.  Not for the benefit of the presenter, but rather out of respect for the size of the audience.</p>

        San Francisco Party Ideas

    </h2>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>Because most Silicon Valley parties are stale and repetitive.</p>

<h2 id="the-nsa-party">The NSA Party!</h2>
<p>By far the most secure party on this list.  Nothing will be stolen from anyone at this party, because all attendees and conversations will be recorded (on video and audio), and fully transcribed.  This information may or may not be “hacked”, making it available for everyone with an internet connection, several days post party completion.</p>

<h2 id="the-anonymous-party">The Anonymous Party</h2>
<p>Everyone wears guy fawkes masks, making everyone anonymous and unrecognizable. The event will begin with a political campaign to extradite Bradley Manning, but people will likely get bored quickly, turning the event instead into a prank calling exposition.  Illegal activity will be encouraged.  Then the police will arrive and it may or may not be discovered that the party organizers were actually FBI informants.  Sign up would be done publicly on Facebook, for convenience.</p>

<h2 id="the-philanthropist-party">The Philanthropist Party</h2>
<p>Here we publicly pledge to give away most of our money to charity, on the one condition that we become billionaires first.  </p>

<h2 id="the-silicon-valley-job-creation-party">The Silicon Valley Job Creation Party</h2>
<p>At this party, we’ll hire a well payed programmer to make a machine to serve us drinks.  A minority of the profits from ticket sales will altruistically go to an immigration bill targeting Indian programmers with hydraulics experience.</p>

<h2 id="the-fox-news-party">The Fox News Party</h2>
<p>This will actually just be a fun party, just to throw people off.</p>

<h2 id="the-party-venture-to-save-the-world">The Party Venture to Save the World!</h2>
<p>The party managers create a brand new type of charity event that is incredibly effective.  The party becomes a surprising success, and within only 2 hours, sees the pledges of tens of thousands of dollars to Greenpeace. At a randomized time, a public company “purchases” the venture for branding purposes and the party abruptly ends, offering everyone 36 seconds to exit. </p>

<h2 id="the-social-entrepreneur-party">The Social Entrepreneur Party</h2>
<p>At this party no one is permitted to talk about social ventures, but instead to discuss how important it is to have parties that promote social ventures.</p>

<h2 id="the-1-party">The 1% Party</h2>
<p>This is pretty much already a typical Bay Area party.</p>

<h2 id="the-99-party">The 99% Party</h2>
<p>Essentially the same group of people from the 1% party, but here complaining about not being invited to the the 0.01% party (which is much fancier).</p>

<h2 id="the-instagram-party">The Instagram Party</h2>
<p>Picture taking is encouraged, especially through cell phones.  Attendees win prizes like “most popular” in online badge form.  Managers get all photos taken at the event, and proceed to sell them all on iStockPhoto to help pay for the party.  </p>

<h2 id="the-dress-like-an-anti-internet-bill-party">The “Dress Like an Anti-Internet Bill Party”</h2>
<p>No description needed, use your imagination a bit.</p>

<h2 id="the-global-warming-party">The Global Warming Party</h2>
<p>The party takes place in a huge hall with blocks of ice instead of chairs and tables.  Heat will be on full, so the party will transition into a pool party, then a hot tub party.  During this time we’ll discuss the importance of issues like bank corruption and SOPA.  </p>

        The Time Devil: A Very Depressing Look at How Time Discounting Can Ruin Us

  <p>This was originally my final research paper for The Economics of Technology and Growth class at Claremont Mckenna College.  Basically, what I am aiming to prove here is that technology can be harmful to us mainly because of our cognitive biases.  In this case I choose time discounting because it is well studied and known, but it is only one of several possible options.  I attempt to use mathematics and simulations to see just how much the technological results of our time discounting could be sub-optimal for us.  Feel free to download this on <a href="http://www.academia.edu/3508481/Devil_of_Discounting">Academica.edu</a>, or download the <a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/devil-of-discounting.pdf">PDF</a> or <a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/devil-of-discounting-1.docx">Word</a> document.  This work is all now under Creative Commons Attribution License.  Enjoy.    </p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>There is widespread acknowledgement between economists and psychologists that humans use time discounting when making decisions. (Shane Frederick, 2002) (Gal Zauberman, 2009)  This research examines net-negative choices that humans may willingly make because of this discounting.  First a “devil curve” model is described which studies the maximum possible utility loss a human may experience with very specific new choices.  The discount loss is calculated under different conditions of period number and discount factor.  The possibility and extent of trade between individuals with different time discount functions is studied.  Finally the implications of this are used to observe the impact of time discounting on the benefits of technology and choice in a mathematical simulation.  It is found that time discounting has the potential to cause great disutility, and may already doing so.  </p>

<h2 id="a-short-fable">A Short Fable</h2>
<p>You’re walking through the woods and a devil appears.  Before you can run, he claims that there’s not enough freedom in society.  Humanity needs more choices, more ideas, more technologies.  You’re suspicious, but he swears that he won’t lie or deceive you.  The Devil promises you an infinite number of choices.  He will tell you exactly how much good each will do you throughout your life. You trust the devil enough to be honest and decide you might as well listen to him.  You’ve had a strong belief in freedom and choice and trust yourself to be logical. After all, how bad could this possibly be?  </p>

<h2 id="the-first-choice">The First Choice</h2>
<p>He offers you a large delicious juicy red apple.  He tells you that eating it will give you a small headache, but not for 20 years.  You are quite hungry.  The headache will result in about two times as much pain as this apple will bring you joy now.  It’s your choice.  Will you accept it?<br />
<a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/apple.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/apple.png" alt="Figure 2: Juicy Red Apple (Tembhekar)" /> </a>  </p>

<p><strong>Probably.</strong>  The most optimistic estimates on human discount rates estimate it at around 5.6%.  Using hyperbolic discounting this would mean that a typical human discounts utility from 20 years in the future by approximately 53%. (Steffen Andersen, 2011)  Therefor the victim in this case would value the headache at approximately (1-0.53)*2 = 0.94 times the enjoyment of the apple now.  This person would accept the deal with the devil.  </p>

<h2 id="the-utility-and-discount-curves">The Utility and Discount Curves</h2>
<p>Let’s consider how much damage these deals can do.  First we assume hyperbolic discounting of utility with time.  Often economists use exponential discounting for convenience, but hyperbolic discounting has been shown to be a more accurate model for predicting human behavior. (Steffen Andersen, 2011)   </p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/3-larger.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/3-larger.png?w=922" alt="Hyperbolic vs. Exponential Discount Factors (Moxfyre)" /> </a> </p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/hyperbolic-exponential-discount-functions.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/hyperbolic-exponential-discount-functions.png" alt="hyperbolic-exponential-discount-functions" /> </a></p>

<p>The graph and equations above show the differences between hyperbolic and exponential curves.  In general a hyperbolic curve has a longer “tail” then its exponential equivalent.  Most of the results in this paper are only shown for hyperbolic discount functions. Humans on average lost significantly more utility when exponential functions were tried, although this was in part because hyperbolic and exponential curves with the same discount factors were compared to each other, as opposed to choosing ones with similar integrals instead. To model the deal with the devil, we assume that the human is expecting to live 50 years with constant utility for that time.  This constant utility is standardized to 1.  We assume a discount factor of 0.1, or 10%.  This is higher than the most optimistic estimates, but less than many others. The following curves represent utility and the “discount coefficient” (The amount that utility in a given period is discounted due to the discount factor).  </p>

The individual can be modeled to have a decision function, D, which is used to decide whether or not to accept choices.  “Greedy choices” are ones in which a person would sacrifice utility from the future in order to gain utility in the present.  In these cases, the “decision equation” can be used to tell when the person will make a choice.</p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/delta-d.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/delta-d.png" alt="delta-d" /> </a></p>

<p>When ΔD &gt; 0, the choice will be made. In this case we are studying “devil choices”, which are “greedy choices” with maximum possible harm to the participant.  To achieve this, a decision is given in which just enough utility is given in the present to get the participant to agree to give up an amount of utility in the future.  This can be assumed to be a negligible amount, and thus ΔD ~ 0 and we find the following relationship.</p>

<p>   <a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/utility-equation-1.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/utility-equation-1.png" alt="utility-equation-1" /> </a></p>

<p>The second important equation is the net utility calculation, which determines the net utility difference after a choice is made.  ΔU is the change in utility.</p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/utility-equation-2.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/utility-equation-2.png?w=300" alt="utility-equation-2" /> </a></p>

<p>Combining these two equations, we find the following</p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/utility-equation-3-repeat.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/utility-equation-3-repeat.png?w=300" alt="utility-equation-3-repeat" /> </a></p>

<p>Finally, we set Uf to 1 (as previously assumed), and dp to 1 (which is always true).  Thus, we find the following relationship between utility loss and discount coefficient for each period.</p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/utility-equation-4.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/utility-equation-4.png?w=300" alt="utility-equation-4" /> </a></p>

<h2 id="the-devil-curve">The Devil Curve</h2>
<p>This utility loss of devil choices can be shown graphically, as shown below.  Conveniently, the utility loss for each period can be thought of as the distance between the discount coefficient and the original expected utility at that period.</p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/devil-curve.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/devil-curve.png?w=922" alt="Maximum Discount Loss for One Period" /> </a></p>

<p>The sum of losses for all periods (“The Region of Discount Loss”) can be represented in the region between the utility curve and the discount curve, as shown below.  In the condition of Devil Choices, the line separating both regions is considered to be the “Devil Curve”.</p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/devil-curve-clean.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/devil-curve-clean.png?w=922" alt="Devil Curve" /> </a></p>

<p>In this case, with D = 0.1 and t = 50, the region of discount loss was calculated to be 63%.  This means that the devil would able to steal 63% of the victim’s utility just by giving him specific choices that he accepted.  Given these reasonable parameters, and lots of specific freedoms, the otherwise rational victim will ruin most of his life.  </p>

<h2 id="it-gets-worse">It Gets Worse</h2>
<p>This previous model had a simplifying assumption that is very convenient to the human.  It was assumed that the human could only trade away positive utility.  The utility graph had a bottom at 0 utils.  This may well not be the case, if the human can experience pain and torture without the ability for suicide. Below are models that show how utility floors of negative 1 and negative 2 would change the result of the encounter.  The Devil curve is scaled to visually represent for the greater possible trade region, with the calculations done accordingly.  This does not mean the time discounting curve itself changes, just that it applies a similar proportional impact on the available tradable utility.</p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/deeper-devil-curves.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/deeper-devil-curves.png?w=922" alt="deeper-devil-curves" /> </a></p>

<p>Thus, if a human is capable of experiencing twice as much pain as they were expecting to experience pleasure throughout their average life, then he or she would give up 190% of their entire lifetime utility to the devil.  On average, their life will now be full of misery and suffering.  Of course, if the person could possibly feel more pain, it would be even worse.    This situation wouldn’t be much better if the human were to have a smaller discount factor, as will be shown in Figure 6.  For any non-zero discount factor, a very large discount loss is possible.<br />

<h2 id="parameter-variation-in-the-devil-curve">Parameter Variation in the Devil Curve</h2>
<p>The devil curves with 0 floor utility were generated for all combinations of three values of period number and discount factors.  Period numbers of 5, 30, and 100 were used because they span a wide range of typical remaining human lifespans.  A very old person may only expect to live a few more years, and thus would only make decisions for utility in that time.  These period numbers can also be seen as the possible time that one can influence with current choices. The discount factors of 0.05, 0.1, and 0.3 provide a good range for what economists and psychologists typically assume it really is.   These factors can be thought of as representing people with different abilities of self-control, from a priest to a reckless daredevil.  It is possible that these numbers may even change with the mood of individuals. Of course, these factors can also represent countries or organizations.  A government in power for a limited amount of time may only be interested in that time of power.  Fortune-500 companies have lifetimes of between 40-50 years. (Bloomberg Businessweek, 2008)  Governments may have different discount factors based on how frustrated their constituents are.  Businesses may have different discount factors in accordance to how much they focus on monthly reports and short-term profits.  </p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/devil-curve-parameters.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/devil-curve-parameters.png?w=922" alt="Devil Curves for Variations in t (period numbers) and D (discount factor)" /> </a> Devil Curves for Variations in t (period numbers) and D (discount factor)[/caption] Figure 6: Devil Curves for Variations in t (period numbers) and D (discount factor) These results generally conform to what is expected.  As the period number increases, the discount loss increases, as the individual has more time periods to sacrifice.  As the discount factor increases, the individual is prone to trading future utility more. The specific numbers themselves are quite interesting.  There is significantly more variation in discount loss between the period numbers then between the discount values studied.  Even “saints” with very low discount values are still susceptible to great harm by this devil.  While it’s definitely not much of a factor for old people (the riskiest of whom have discount losses of up to 32%), this definitely seems significant for everyone else.</p>

<h2 id="the-devil-inside">The Devil Inside</h2>
<p>Fortunately appearances by the Devil don’t seem to be very common these days.  However, the Devil Curve model showed us how bad the choices available to us could be. Here we consider two ways that net-harmful decisions could still be made.  The first is by trading “Discount Utility”, and the second is by chance when common choices and technologies.</p>

<h2 id="discount-utility-and-trade">Discount Utility and Trade</h2>
<p>In the previous model, the devil was assumed to know the human’s decision curve precisely, and make decisions accordingly.    In essence, the “trade surplus” was completely delivered to the supplier, the devil.  When humans trade with each other the recipient of the trade surplus is not as clear, but the extent of trade should be similar to the devil deal. Consider two individuals with different discount curves.  One has a discount factor of 0.1, the other has a discount factor of 0.2.  In this case one unit of utility in year 20 is worth approximately 0.33 in year 1 the first individual, but would be worth approximately 0.2 for the second.</p>

<p>We can see that the different time discounting factors are essentially comparative advantages for both people, but in willingness to make certain decisions instead of production capabilities.   In this case, persons 1 and 2 will accept trades of between 0.2 and 0.3 present utils from person 1 to person 2 in exchange for 1 future util.  The net utility caused by both possible trades is shown below.</p>

<p>This total “decision surplus” can be represented in graphical form, similar to the previous curves.  The entire discount loss region of the individual with the higher discount curve should always be exchanged from the low-discount rate individual to the high-discount rate individual.  The only region in question is the area between both individuals’ discount curves.</p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/utilitarian-trade.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/utilitarian-trade.png?w=922" alt="utilitarian-trade" /> </a></p>

<p>As this graph makes apparent, for individuals with similar discount curves, this small region isn’t even that important.  It is simply the negotiation room.  On the whole, a large discount loss region will be exchanged between them, causing an incredibly large shift in utility. This is an incredibly disturbing finding because it implies that individuals with even very small differences in their discount curves would lead to massive utility imbalances.  Perhaps fortunately, these kinds of trades mostly aren’t possible yet. One implication of this is that organizations with relatively low discount factors will seek out groups with high discount factors who are willing to trade, and greatly damage them by making very large exchanges.  For example, credit companies finding at-risk individuals, and banks lending to political organizations in unstable countries.   These trades are often limited by a difficulty in holding long-term contracts.  For example, the ability to declare bankruptcy or to have a limited liability company could make it very difficult for “predatory” companies to collect on future profits, limiting their trading potential with susceptible individuals and thus protecting these individuals.  This may be one of the few cases where weak contracts may be beneficial to a society: here they ultimately protect people and organizations from themselves. This may also hint at the presence of an informal “market of discount utility”.  For example, careers requiring different discount factors will be compensated accordingly.  Careers that require little, or enjoyable, training, will be compensated less than those that require lots of upfront sacrifice, even if both groups of careers are equivalent in total net utility without the compensation.  Similar possibilities exist for infrastructure and technology improvements on the behalf of countries and companies in settings of potential trade.</p>

<h2 id="technology-and-the-utility-vs-decision-matrix">Technology and the Utility vs. Decision Matrix</h2>
<p>Here we consider the impacts of time discounting on the net utility provided by technology.  In essence technology can be modeled as the presence of choice.  The conception of a technology itself does nothing unless individuals choose to purchase and use it.  Thus new technologies can be modeled in similar ways as choices in the devil model. We assume that technologies do not naturally have any moral or time bias.  People are always coming up with new ideas, each of which can be represented as a choice with varying utility contribution over a given time set.  To attempt to imagine all possible technology utility curves, we simulate each new technology as a random utility function over time.  Each point on this curve (or noisy line) has an equal probability of being anywhere between 1 and -1, representing the addition or removal of utility. To decide whether or not to accept a technology, a person will multiply their time discount curve by the technology’s utility curve, resulting in the “decision function”.  The sum, or integral, of this function is called the “decision factor”.  If this were positive the individual would be willing to accept the technology, if it is negative he or she wouldn’t be.<br />
<img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/lifetime-utility.png" alt="The Utility Function for a new technology, the Time Discount Curve, and the resulting Decision Function" /> ](http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/lifetime-utility.png) The Utility Function for a new technology, the Time Discount Curve, and the resulting Decision Function  </p>

<p>We also study the “total utility”, which is the integral of the lifetime utility of a given technology.  When this is positive the technology will be net-beneficial in utility, and when it is negative the technology will be net-harmful. In this case we are primarily interested in impacts of “bad choices taken”, which are those with positive decision factors but negative total utility.  These are the choices we take because of our time discounting bias, but which will ultimately harm us. In regards to total utility and decision factors, four main categories emerge, one being the “bad choices taken”.  These can be put in matrix form as shown below.  The placement of each category matches its quadrant in the following simulation plot.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td> </td>
      <td>Negative Decision Factor</td>
      <td>Positive Decision Factor</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Positive Total Utility</td>
      <td>Good Choices Not Taken</td>
      <td>Good Choices Taken</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Negative Total Utility</td>
      <td>Bad Choices Not Taken</td>
      <td>Bad Choices Taken</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Using Matlab, several thousand “technologies” were simulated.  The decision factors and total utility of can be plotted on a scatterplot.  White lines are placed to highlight the x and y axis, dividing the plot into 4 quadrants.  This plot is called a “Utility Vs. Decision Matrix”.  First, we show what this plot looks like for a simulation using a period size of 50 and a discounting factor of 0.1.</p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/utility-vs-decision.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/utility-vs-decision.png?w=922" alt="utility-vs-decision" /> </a></p>

<p>As shown, the technologies generally span from the bottom left to the top right.  This makes sense, as the utility curves were generated with no correlation between present and future utilities.  People take technologies primarily based on what’s good in the short term, and there’s no negative correlation between this region and the left utility region, so on average these decisions result in positive utility. The “decision average” is the mean total utility of all taken choices, which are all those on the right of the y-axis.  This is shown as a red line in quadrant 1.  The “optimal average” is the mean total utility of all taken choices without the “bad choices”, which are those in the upper right quadrant. This is shown is the red line in quadrant 1. The discount loss is the percentage difference between the optimal and decision averages, representing the average utility lost per choice due to the presence of the bad choices.  The percentage of all choices taken (on the right half) that are bad (on the bottom right quadrant) is also shown, as “bad choices taken”.  This number represents the percentage of choices that an individual will take that will be net-harmful. The results of this simulation tell us a few things.  There are more “good choices” then bad ones, with bad choices making up 16% of the total choices taken.  On average these reduce our benefits from technology by 22%, which is quite significant.  If this model were true it would mean that approximately one of every six choices you make will your life worse.<br />

<h2 id="parameter-variation-in-utility-vs-decision-simulations">Parameter Variation in Utility Vs. Decision Simulations</h2>
<p>Utility vs. decision simulations were done with all combinations of discount factors of 5%, 10%, and 30%, and period size of 5, 30, and 100.  The results are shown in the graphs below.<br />
<a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/full-matrix-1.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/full-matrix-1.png" alt="Utility vs. Decision Factor simulations for variations in P (period numbers) and D (discount factor)" /> </a> Utility vs. Decision Factor simulations for variations in P (period numbers) and D (discount factor)</p>

<p>There general patterns of these simulations correspond which is what is expected.  In general, the U vs. D plot is more linear and less scattered the less the discount rate and the less the period size.  This makes sense: without either, there would be no “bad choices” and thus no points would fall in the fourth quadrant. These results are similar to what we would have expected from the results of the devil models. The numbers don’t vary as much as may have been suspected.  It seems that as a rule of thumb, people may assume that at least 10% - 20% of technologies are harmful to themselves, and should make decisions accordingly.  </p>

<h2 id="room-for-improvement">Room for Improvement</h2>
<p>There are several possible factors that are not in this model, but would suggest a more harmful or beneficial view of choices if they could be incorporated.  </p>

<h3 id="harmful-factors">Harmful Factors</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Other Biases</strong> <br />
 Time discounting is only one of the many biases humans have.  The impacts of our biases of non-rational risk taking are not considered.  Neither are the cognitive biases, or even false popular beliefs.  </li>
  <li><strong>Marketing</strong>  <br />
 This model assumed perfect information about the results of technological choices.  This is very rarely the case, as marketers often misrepresent their products.  It is unclear if “bad choices” will be misrepresented disproportionately, but it seems to.  </li>
  <li><strong>Externalities</strong><br />
 What about choices that when taken, help or harm other people?  People seem to prefer their own utility to that of others.  This has poor implications for the devil curve, but the implications in regards to technology would depend on the power people have over each other.  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="useful-factors">Useful Factors</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Group Regulation</strong><br />
 The government occasionally bans or taxes items that are considered harmful for individuals, such as cigarettes and heroin.  Social groups often provide cultural influence to bias people away from actually generally seen as short sighted (for example, adultery).  </li>
  <li><strong>Diminishing Marginal Returns</strong><br />
             In this model people trade utility, but this is never really the case in real life.  Instead technologies provide emotions and material benefits, which are bound with diminishing marginal returns, possibly restricting individuals from taking many of specific harmful actions (eating cookies, for example).</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>This paper presents a rather stark analysis of humanity’s ability to deal with choice.  The devil curves show potential utility losses of up to 88% given reasonable parameters.  The inquiry on utility trade brings up the possibility that given better trading tools, incredibly large utility shifts may occur between otherwise logical individuals.  Finally the Utility vs. Decision simulations reveal that due to time discounting, approximately 15% of our existing technologies could be net-harmful to us.  This demonstrates that time discounting may be incredibly damaging to modern society.   It is recommended that further analysis is done to understand ways to counter this force.</p>

<h2 id="the-original-problem">The Original Problem</h2>

<p>Most people I know consider themselves to be relatively moral individuals, no matter what kind of morality they ascribe to.  Almost every single piece of literature we read and a large majority of politics hangs onto the ideal of moral righteousness in one form or another.  So when people like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Singer">Peter Singer</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Yudkowsky">Eliezer Yudiskowsky</a> goes out and state that <a href="http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/199704--.htm">conventional morality is bullshit</a>, people <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Singer#Criticism_of_Singer">freak out</a>. The basic argument goes that we typically judge morality based on initions we have, rather than facts and rigorous analysis.  And this leads to <a href="http://intelligence.org/files/CognitiveBiases.pdf">strange things</a>, like seeking moral vengeance against people who kill one or two individuals, while not blaming people with the ability to save millions of lives but not doing so.  Our intuitions were created from evolution optimized for cavemen, and whatever social norms and media we are subjected to.  They are are faulty due to numerous <a href="http://intelligence.org/files/CognitiveBiases.pdf">cognitive biases</a>, and a moral standing upon them is difficult to de-couple from complete  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_relativism">moral relativism</a>, an incredibly undesirable state for intellectual morality. So in a way, most modern morality is built upon strong intuitions.  The issue is that these intuitions are inconsistent and provably flawed for the modern era.  If we live out our entire lives and build societies based on these moral intuitions, then we are arguably doing almost everything on top of some very shaky foundations. I’ll use a few comics from the excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Logicomix-An-Epic-Search-Truth/dp/1596914521/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368222515&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=logicomix">Logicomix</a> to help illustrate my point.  That book detailed the mathematical venture into complete proof and certainty against intuition, and I feel like that was very similar to what we are now going through with morality.  </p>

<p>How to we fix this?  The existing fight against moral intuition has come from  utilitarianism and effective altruism.  These groups try to deduce why our important intuitions exist to help prove which ones are morally true and which are cultural and/or evolutionary artifacts.  Utilitarianism was somewhat of an attempt to create an overal structure that is somewhat intuitively reasonable but most importantly, numerical.  Basically, we define “goodness” in some way (often defined as “happiness”, but possibly “awesomeness” or any other word you might consider to be a reasonable ultimate human goal) and define moral good as to whatever reaches that.  The Effective Altruist group kind of grew out of this to help define good life practices (like donating to efficient charities rather than cute ones) that help optimize this number.  Often this seems unintuitive (for example, it may be very justifiable to not give to homeless people close to you and instead donate to charities you will never see), but can be defended well with math. Basic practices here are to do things like encouraging people to live lives that favored large donations to efficient charities, rather than typical bleeding-heart goodwill.  Others work on projects “orders of magnitude” more useful than anyone else in mainstream society, including researching the Singularity, ending human aging, and human computer uploading.  On paper these are incredible useful activities, because they are so much better than what is mainstream.  People doing these can feel quite morally superior to the rest of society, and still feel the logically reasonable ability to complain morally about war criminals and resist moral relativism.</p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/line.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/line.png?w=922" alt="line" /> </a></p>

<p>Above shows a basic diagram of how I see the the “morality” of individuals based on something like utilitarianism.  While I chose “Expected Average Lives Saved (or Equivalent)”, what we are really talking about is some measure of goodness.  Peter Singer well reasons that people who choose not to do good should be faced with similar scrutiny as those who choose to do harm.  Likewise, the only “moral” position is to do as “much as possible”, which is generally defined as “Effective Altruism”, that box on the right.  The groups mentioned all fit into this general category, and from their perspective, they are all somewhat in the same position.</p>

<h2 id="trouble-in-paradise">Trouble In Paradise</h2>

<p>This all works out well, until even more effective rationalists appear.  Perhaps they come in the form of strict <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_Intelligence_Research_Institute">AI-risk reducers</a>, or something else we haven’t seen yet.</p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/line2.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/line2.png" alt="line2" /> </a></p>

<p>Keep in mind that each bar is an order of magnitude greater than the last one, so in comparison to the “more effective altruists”, the “effective altruists” look 10x to 100x as suboptimal.  The “effective altruists” claim that regular people were imoral because they only save 1 life rather than 1000 (resulting in 999 unnecessary deaths), but here come this other group complaining that the “effective altruists” are saving 1k rather than 100k lives (resulting in 99,000 unnecessary deaths).</p>

<p>The trouble is that one of the main justifications for the work of many effective altruists is that they are much “better in comparison” to everyone else.  Being “better” only makes one “good” when one only cares about comparisons.  Was the “best” Nazi a “good” person, because he or she should be compared to other Nazis, or a “bad” one, because we happen to have non-nazis to compare him or her to?  If one’s morality is rooted in its comparison to that of other’s, then one can go from “good” to “bad” just by the appearance of a new group.</p>

<h2 id="the-annoying-pupils">The Annoying Pupils</h2>

<p>Rejecting intuitive solutions presents all kinds of other nasty issues, if you were to take it to the extreme.  This would mean that there is almost no point where one can really say “oh, this makes basic sense, so I’ll accept this premise and work from there”.  And when one decides to create an entire personal philosophy off of preferring rationality to intuition, the rabbit hole can go much deeper than individual prefers.  At every level of logical thought, there can be someone new who complains that it’s not completely rational, and little rational reason for proving that it shouldn’t be.</p>

<p>Typically when we make logical decisions, we ultimately come down to a few intuitive things.  For example, we may optimize a business strategy for revenue, but we still make the intuitive decision that revenue is what we should be optimizing for.  One can go further and “rationally” explain why revenue is statistically expected to be the best way for the business to grow, but from there, there’s the intuitive assumption that the growth of the business is a good thing.  Several other intuitive assumptions are probably made in the rest of the model as well, it is almost impossible to make a complete model without them.</p>

<p>So the big question is how to decide where to make intuitive judgements vs. rational ones.  But to decide this question, there should ideally be a rational answer.  If there were an intuitive one, that would mean an intuitive foundation, which leads us back to where we started.  And finding a rational answer that we agree upon can be incredibly difficult.</p>

<h2 id="levels-of-goodness-intuition">Levels of Goodness Intuition</h2>

<p>Let’s begin with an example.  When deciding on donating to a poorly run childcare charity compared to a well run one, the choice is relatively obvious within most definitions of “good”.  So within many definitions of “good”, the answer could be made relatively easily.</p>

<p>But take something more extreme: what if we need to choose between the lives of 4 cows compared to 1 human being?  Or 1000 <a href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/humane-insecticides.html">insects</a> (expected, though highly unlikely) compared to 1 human being?</p>

<p>The typical answer that I’ve heard for this, is to make an intuitive judgement about how important a cow is to a human.  Perhaps cows are 1/3rd as intelligent, then 4 cows “utility” would be greater than that of one human.  But the “utility” is a very difficult thing to define, and many people really only care to optimize human utility.</p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/human.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/human.png" alt="human" /> </a></p>

<p>Even worse is when this taken to the computational extreme.  Many futurists advocate human brain <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Mind_uploading">uploading to machines</a>.  They claim that simulated cognition is equivalent to physical cognition, and simulations of us could be much better taken care of than real ones.  Others find this scenario as repulsive and wrong.</p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/physical.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/physical.png" alt="physical" /> </a></p>

<p>Some take another step and say that instead of us being uploaded into an amazing world, we should go straight to <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Wireheading">wireheading</a>, into a state where our brains get pure “happiness” without realized experiences.  This is very controversial but seems very counter-intuitive and strange to other values we have.  As <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Wireheading">lesswrong</a> points out,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A civilization of wireheads “blissing out” all day while being fed and maintained by robots would be a state of maximum happiness, but such a civilization would have no art, love, scientific discovery, or any of the other things humans find valuable.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some take this further and say that if simulations of us are more “optimal” than us, then wouldn’t simulations of even “happier” beings be more optimal?  Or perhaps an A.I. should just simulate “pleasure” itself, essentially ending living sentience as we know it and replacing it completely with machines simulating things we can not now possibly imagine.  There are some that feel like for any given definition of “happiness”, this would be preferable, but others who feel like it is morally wrong for us because of its lack of most existing human values.</p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/terminator.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/terminator.png" alt="terminator" /> </a></p>

<p>The one “completely rational” utilitarian answer that makes sense (is intuitive as being rational) to me is just that, that ultimately the most utility would come from replacing all current sentience with completely artificial beings (or being).  Essentially, not only letting the Matrix or Terminator overlords win the fight, but rushing for this to happen, fighting for it, and doing whatever is necessary.  On the strictest definitions of utility I could imagine, this would be the most analytically optimal thing.  Of course, that is for now, until I hear of another idea that could be 10x to 100x as “optimal” as this one.</p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/line3.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/line3.png" alt="line3" /> </a></p>

<p>But of course, essentially all people reject this final bit.  The wire heading promoters will say that they are promoting the best outcome (and thus are doing by far the most efficient utilitarian work), and claim that the “terminator” scenario is morally apprehensible because of how wrong it _feels _in comparison.   The uploading enthusiasts will promote theirs as the best outcome while claiming that the wire heading outcome is unnatural and obviously wrong.  The human utopians will promote theirs as the best outcome while claiming that human uploading is un-human in comparison.  And local charity enthusiasts will insist that their work is the best, and the intuitive good feelings it provides would be missed by the “effective altruists”, and thus would wouldn’t be reasonable.</p>

<p>Also, I’ll note that quite a few people in the field of futuristic high-technology “effective altruism” are very much intent on themselves being a part of this.  That they themselves would get to live forever or be uploaded.  When asked why they prefer this to something that could mathematically produce much higher expected value, I hear answers like “this is already good enough!”  But how do we possibly decide rationally what “good enough” means, especially when there is something obvious better?</p>

<p>The great difficulty here, as I see it, is that the extreme moral stance, with as little intuition as possible, seems to be the terminator scenario or similar, areas that seems completely morally strange and unintuitive to absolutely everybody.  But if one were to do more “reasonable” things, one may make order-of-magnitude losses in efficiency for the sake of achieving a more intuitive answer, which was the entire problem we started out against.  We could make a trade-off in between (like many I know do), but such a trade-off would also be an intuitive one.</p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/second.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/second.png" alt="second" /> </a></p>

<h2 id="where-to-go-from-here">Where to Go From Here</h2>

<p>If one does accept some intuitive limitations from terminator support (or other intuitive options like keeping 10% of income because it “feels right”), at least we could admit it and realize that we aren’t that much different from those “inefficient altruists” or even “regular people” who make different intuitive limitations than we do.  This is in many ways moral relativism and leads to a vague and somewhat frustrated form of morality, but at least not a hypocritical one.  Being honest to ourselves is a good first step.</p>

<p>I believe that really finding a rational ends that we can agree upon will take quite a bit of change to our own intuitions   It may just be a matter of time, like it was to get reduce other limitions (nationalism, sexism, racism, etc).  Of course, the issue is that the time required may be longer than available before apocalyptic / world changing event, so it is quite likely this will never be settled.</p>

<p>I do believe that this should be figured out and discussed much more rigorously.  Because from what I’ve seen, many of <strong><em>the most important</em></strong> moral issues are still surrounded by relatively emotional and intutive debate.  And for us being “rationality nerds”, this is quite a huge deal.</p>

        Plotting Capability vs. Ambition
      </a>
    </h2>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>When I was in school (up to college), I was often frustrated by a lack of ambition in students around me.  The main problem in my area, to me, was a lack of ambition.  Surely, all these people could have much more awesome and useful lives if they strived for more? Of course, others see the world as a place of too much ambition, something that I see here in San Francisco.  Many entrepreneurs have hopes that are unbelievably and unrealistically high, and it’s quite apparent that they will eventually get let down.  Also of note are the yuppies who may always hope to gain 30% more income.  Here the issue is perhaps over-ambition and eventual disappointment. </p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/intro.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/intro.png" alt="Basic Capability vs. Ambition Graph" /> </a>  </p>

<p>Here’s a basic plot of Ambition vs. Capability.   To help illustrate it’s meaning, I’ve broken it up into 4 quadrant archetypes.  Delusional people have lots of ambition (“I’m going to invent a singularity!”) but very little capability.  Heroes have lots of ambition and the capability to make it happen.  ”Genius slackers” are people who have lots of resources to do good, but lack the care to do it.  And the “cripples” are those who aren’t in the position to do much, and don’t care to anyway.  </p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/ideal.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/ideal.png" alt="ideal" /> </a>  </p>

<p>Theoretically, we could imagine a line being drawn to match each level of ambition with the exact amount of capability that it can achieve.  Basically this would state, “a person who can make at most $90k per year would hope to make 90k per year”.  Here I consider this line to be the “ideal”, and will repeatedly show it as a reference for comparison.  </p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/different-losses.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/different-losses.png" alt="different-losses" /> </a>  </p>

<p>Individuals above this line have ambition exceeding capability, leading to eventual disappointment.  Individuals below this line have capability exceeding ambition, leading to a missed opportunity for their capability.  Here I consider this as deadweight economic loss.  </p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/different-ideals.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/different-ideals.png" alt="different-ideals" /> </a> </p>

<p>Now, to be fair, it may be that this “Capability-Ambition Ideal” is not actually ideal for each individual or for society.  It just represents the exact match of the two.  Hypothetically, one can imagine that an individual striving to do more than they are capable of may be more productive than he or she would otherwise, and thus may benefit society more than if striving for what is possible.  This may be because he or she will only reach what is possible if he or she strives for much more, leading to personal disappointment but capability efficiency.  On the other hand, it may be optimal for the individuals’ well-being to strive for less than they are capable of, and enjoy life or do other things instead. </p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/dissapointment.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/dissapointment.png" alt="dissapointment" /> </a> </p>

<p>So far “Capability” and “Ambition” have been talked about in very general terms, but let’s make it much more specific.  Let’s say we want to look at the average ambition for each group of people with similar capabilities.  Then we can create a curve for the “Actual Average Ambition” within a society or set of people.  We can also look at “capability” and “ambition” for one specific variable, such as income. I imagine that the U.S. Monetary Capability vs. Ambition Plot would look something like what is shown above.  In general I understand that people hope for more money then they get, leading to people working very hard and continually being disappointed.</p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/losses.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/losses.png" alt="losses" /> </a> </p>

<p>On the other hand, I imagine that with regards to helping the world (utility maximization), people aren’t nearly as ambitious as they have the capability to achieve.  A possible plot is above. That’s all I have for now.  There’s definitely a lot more that can be done here.  My guess is that it wouldn’t be too difficult to actually make some of these graphs.  Of course, knowing exactly how capable someone is is impossible, so for it to be realistic it should all be statistical, but I think these first iterations help show the basic points.</p>

        Don&#8217;t Bash Entrepreneurs for Not Being Ambitious Enough
      </a>
    </h2>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>Seriously, please stop bashing entrepreneurs for not being ambitious enough.  It’s like bashing nonprofit workers for not working hard enough to help people in need.  </p>

<p><img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/5685441530_5136658664_b.jpg?w=922" alt="Hackers, Clearly Not Being Very Ambitious" /> ](http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/5685441530_5136658664_b.jpg) “If only these people were more ambitious, then our economy would be doing well.” ( <a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/hackny/5685441530/in/photostream/">photo</a> by Elena Oliva)[/caption] </p>

<p>The basic argument, that I’ve heard <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ciocentral/2012/04/10/think-big-why-entrepreneurs-should-target-ambitious-ideas/">time</a> and <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2013/04/02/an-acquisition-is-always-a-failure/">time</a> again, is that most entrepreneurs in the valley are working on BS photo social sharing apps with no grand vision or relevance to most people on the planet.  And that it’s <em>their fault</em> for not caring enough. I know a lot of entrepreneurs.  Most are far more ambitious than anyone else seems reasonable.  But even so, here’s a convenient list to help change the conversation from somewhat personal attacks to much broader systemic debate.   </p>

<h2 id="a-short-list-of-reasons-not-to-demand-entrepreneurs-to-be-more-ambitious">A short list of reasons not to demand entrepreneurs to be more ambitious:</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>They’re told not to be.</strong><br />
 Every single VC and angel I’ve talked to has asked for specific business models out of huge ideas and markets.  They’re the ones who provide the capital, it’s near impossible to try to make something big without them. </li>
  <li><strong>They should be told not to be.</strong><br />
 The entire <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">Lean Startup</a> movement pretty much promotes the antithesis of grand visions.  And it has a point.  Major companies almost always begin small and with much more modest intentions then they eventually obtain. </li>
  <li><strong>Photo apps sell.</strong><br />
 Educational apps often don’t.  There are thousands of ambitious and optimistic apps out there, and no one uses them.  Just because Instagram gets the headlines doesn’t mean that all entrepreneurs are trying to build Instagram.  It just means that Instagram is one of the few ideas that consumers like enough to make it successful.  Successes in the industry reflect the market much more than the creators. </li>
  <li><strong>“Greedy” entrepreneurs are orthogonal to “ambitious” ones.</strong><br />
 Entrepreneurs trying to sell out quickly may be quite incompatible to those with grandios visions.  But my guess is that they aren’t competing with each other.  The venture industry will grow as large as there are promising startups, so the photo sharing entrepreneurs aren’t hogging the valley from the ambitious ones.  The issue (if there aren’t ambitious ones), is just that.  The other entrepreneurs are practically a different class of people and are no more to blame for not being “ambitious entrepreneurs” than anyone else with the ability to learn entrepreneurship.  Which means almost everyone. </li>
  <li><strong>Being ambitious gets very ugly.</strong><br />
 I know several people who have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars, or/and years of their lives (and tons of energy and optimism) failing at incredibly ambitious ideas.  <strong>We can’t expect what is essentially martyrdom from a group that’s already self selecting.</strong>  For every Steve Jobs there are 10 others (some quite similar) who don’t make it for whatever reason, and most suffer dearly.  We all know of stories where entrepreneurs have risked everything under small chances to succeed.  But the definition of small chances tells us that most people who max out their credit scores to do something incredible will fail horribly. </li>
  <li><strong>Most people think ambition is crazy.</strong><br />
 While an interestingly vocal group of so-called intellectuals wonder upon the lack of idealism in the tech sector, the vast majority of people who witness it dismiss it and often actively discourage it.  I bet many of these exact intellectuals have completely rejected or dismissed emails from people with incredibly ambitious hopes and claims.  These requests often sound delusional.  Consider an email that states “I’m making something that will replace email!” or similar.  It’s probably a very thin line actually between claims that are considered too uninteresting to pay attention to, and those that are too ambitious to be sane for most people. Both sides are very noisy.   The success of “non-ambitious” startups over “ambitious” ones isn’t personal, it’s systematic, like most issues people argue over.  Also, the moral shortcomings of entrepreneurs are significant, but not necessarily different from the moral shortcomings of everyone else.    </li>
</ol>

        How to Tell if a Web Company Is Evil

    </h2>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>I’m sick of companies cherry picking specific features to explain how they help people.  Specific features will always exist, and the existence of them ruins the point.  The big question is, is it really the purpose of the company to help people, or is helping people an occasional externality of other goals they are trying to achieve?  It’s hard to give someone credit for a positive action that was done for a malicious or unrelated purpose.<br />
<a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/basic.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/basic.png?w=590" alt="Altruistic vs. Power Ven Diagram" title="Altruistic vs. Power Ven Diagram" /> </a></p>

<p>Here’s an Altruism/Power Ven Diagram.  On the left are decisions a company makes to help people, on the right are decisions that give them power.  Figuring out the intentions of a company may have little to do with how much they are helping people, because that intersection may be quite large.  The bigger question is how they pay attention to the other parts of the diagram.</p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/people.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/people.png?w=300" alt="Optimizing for People" /> </a>  </p>

<p>If a company were optimizing for people, it’s actions may look like this.  </p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/shareholders.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/shareholders.png?w=300" alt="If a company optimized for its corporate shareholders, it's actions would be here." /> </a>  </p>

<p>If a company optimized for its corporate shareholders, it’s actions would be here.  </p>

<p>The big question is which of these two above graphs better represents the actions of a company, not how much there is of an intersection to show to the press.  Here’s a graph of what I see as being decisions in each sector, you can decide for yourself what the aims of your favorite web companies may be.  </p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/web-applications.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/web-applications.png?w=300" alt="Web Application Altruism/Power Daigram" /> </a><br />
Web Application Altruism/Power Diagram</p>

<h2 id="doesnt-power-eventually-help-users">Doesn’t Power Eventually Help Users?</h2>
<p>This is the main argument from all power grabbers, ever.  That “with more resources, we can do more good,” so decisions to increase power eventually do help users.  While this can be used to justify almost any action, there does exist the fact that without power even the most idealistic or altruistic groups will not succeed.  It also makes sense that those in power will be those optimized to get power over all other things. It may be that most existing companies (organizations, really) only exist to gain power, where the argument is that the power will eventually be (and occasionally is) used for the goals of these organizations (which are supposedly things other than pure shareholder value). But here, how do you identify groups with good intentions from the rest?  From the outside view, they look almost exactly the same, because they are optimizing for power whenever options are presented. It is true that trade-offs need to be made, but for them to be made well there should be some greater model and rigorous attention to the tradeoffs.  Could companies sponsor studies on how to optimize the numeric trade-offs between short term power grabs and long term civilian value?  It may be hard, but given that these organizations sometimes seem to actually care (or want to care) about value to society, it probably wouldn’t cost much compared to other things they are doing. </p>

<h2 id="the-economic-near-ideal">The Economic Near-Ideal</h2>
<p>Of course, one solution would be to create companies where there are few trade-offs.  One can argue that companies like <a href="https://www.10gen.com/">10gen</a> have nice models where they very well align their own power increases with societal benefit.  </p>

<p>Here companies aren’t defined by how good they are trying to be, but by how much their selfish actions are correlated with altruistic ones.  Here the decision is much more about deciding what kind of company to make (and for outsiders, deciding rules and publicity), then deciding what features to implement.  Yet it also may mean that the more altruistic people will favor industries where this correlation is high, leaving other industries as easy prey for less idealistic people.</p>

        Designing the Feedhaven Ecosystem
      </a>
    </h2>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/screen-shot-2013-04-29-at-11-02-44-pm.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/screen-shot-2013-04-29-at-11-02-44-pm.png?w=922" alt="Feedhaven Diagram 1.0" /> </a>  </p>

<p>We’ve been working a lot recently to figure out what the <a href="http://feedhaven.org/">Feedhaven</a> system should look like.  Right now it’s relatively simple, but to properly work in an ecosystem of applications it would need some additional complexities. </p>

<p><strong>Feedhaven Instances</strong><br />
  In this case a Feedhaven Instance / Server is shown to the right.  A user can set up their own Feedhaven instance, or can use a company’s hosted instance (like <a href="http://feedhaven.com">Feedhaven.com</a>).  This instance is in charge of providing a GUI for the information, storing data on users, handling API keys, and handing the standard Feedhaven data.  This should be able to work on many NoSQL databases, though we plan to begin with MongoDB. </p>

<p><strong>Authentication</strong><br />
  Mozilla Persona seems like a good fit for authentication, especially because it can be standardized among all Feedhaven instances and applications.  Hypothetically Persona could provide proof that an application has confirmation from a user (to send to other applications), but I’m not sure how this would work.  It’s also open source, distributed, easy to set up, and quite minimal.  With Persona integration in the browser, log-in may eventually be a relatively easy thing.  </p>

<p><strong>Data Validation</strong><br />
  Hypothetically all items and feed data would be validated with external JSON schemas with version numbers.  I imagine that for large amounts of data the schemas would have to be cached, and it may be that validation isn’t required, but is possible with an extra function.  </p>

<p><strong>Simple Translation Apps/ Simple Feedhaven Apps</strong><br />
  The idea for this is that users can create API keys with specific permissions at their Feedhaven Instance.  Then this can be given to an external application to allow them to access Feedhaven data without registering with Feedhaven.  Applications that do this would have restricted API call allowances, but this should be fine for many apps.  This is how many major APIs already work; with API tokens for some apps that don’t have to register. These simple apps could do things like read emails from Gmail, convert them to a common email format, and send these to a specific Feedhaven Feed.  They could write or delete specific feeds, and read new common emails from these feeds and then send them off to Gmail.  Whether the app does polling or subscribing to access this content from Feedhaven would be up to the application.  In addition, these apps can be used to just view Feedhaven data. </p>

<p><strong>Translation Manager Apps</strong><br />
  There are hundreds of thousands of applications to talk to, and much of the code to translate each and send/receive to Feedhaven will be the same/similar.  I would imagine/hope that platforms could exist that could accept hundreds or thousands of snippets for conversion with different apps and schemas, and run them as needed. For this, rather than using a standard API token, these apps would have to register directly to each Feedhaven instance.  This should be standardized and done via API calls, when needed. </p>

<p><strong>Future Development</strong><br />
  Of course, the system still needs to be built. The idea is that ecosystem would be fully modular so each part could be built independently based on well defined interfaces.  However, this will take a lot of trial and error as the interfaces are changed based on the workings of the components.  Updates will come at this blog.</p>

        Consumer Fishtraps
      </a>
    </h2>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/121378.jpg"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/121378.jpg?w=487" alt="Image" /> </a></p>

<p>Fishtraps are devices that are easy to enter and difficult or impossible to exit from.  Many products and web apps work the same way. One example may be the <a href="http://www.freecreditreport.com/">monthly service </a>that requires a short website to sign up to but a very long phone call process to stop.  Web services can do similar by making it really simple to sign up and start adding information, but almost impossible to export your data once you use the service. Companies spend a lot of time and effort optimizing their entrences.  There are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_14?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=landing%20page%20optimization&amp;sprefix=landing+page+o%2Caps%2C213&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Alanding%20page%20optimization">several books</a> on Landing Page Optimization / SEO / AB testing on acquiring users.  There’s basically nothing on how to allow users to gracefully leave. Easy web exiting capabilities for consumers would mean data (and permissions and API) interoperability which would mean open standards.  This is one big reason why open standards are important.  But open web standards over the last 10 years have been very rough and frustrating, much because of a reluctance of companies to allow their users to easily leave their platforms.   </p>

<h2 id="the-facebook-example">The Facebook Example</h2>
<p>To start using Facebook, there’s one clean landing page.  Once you get in, Facebook will give you lots of help finding friends for you.  They will then recommend you to people who “might” know you, to help make sure that you get comfortable quickly.  The entire process is incredibly simple and easy. But say you get tired of Facebook, and want to try Google+.  You can close your Facebook account, but they will keep the information forever (allowing you to re-enter as easily as possible).  If you search through the option settings, you may find that on the bottom of the “general account settings” page, there’s a way to “download a copy” of your Facebook data.  This brings you to another page, as shown below.</p>

<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/screen-shot-2013-04-28-at-3-38-55-pm.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/screen-shot-2013-04-28-at-3-38-55-pm.png" alt="Facebook Archive Page" /> </a></p>

<p>If you click “Start My Archive”, you actually won’t get that much data.  The full archive link is actually that small “expanded archive” link on the bottom.  From there you enter your password and wait. Several hours later you’ll get an email letting you know your archive is ready.  It comes as a folder with several HTML webpages of your pictures, friends, private messages, and profile information.  Not CSV, not JSON, but HTML data. Then you realize that even that doesn’t have the status updates of you or your friends.  I don’t know how many people use Facebook primarily as a photo sharing service, but I’m going to go on a limb and say that the main thing people do on Facebook is post to and read from status updates.  So Facebook is essentially not giving the most important user data to them. And even then, there’s really no way I know of importing any of that data to Google+ or Twitter or Diaspora.  Because in order to do that, these programs would have to make a program that you would download, just to format this HTML and then upload it to another service. The saddest part is that even this is considered <strong>better than average</strong> for web services.</p>

<h2 id="solutions">Solutions</h2>
<p>The only existing protection against this seem to be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">EU’s legal action</a> and occasionally consumer sentiment. Hypothetically, it could be possible for a browser extension to warn users about lock-in on visits to website sign-up pages.  If enough people used these or did some research, it could be possible that companies would take notice and respond accordingly.  We really just need people to care. In the mean time, just realize.  When you are on these platforms, you are essentially in a fish trap.  Leaving may technically be feasible, but it’s made to be near impossible.   For more info on “evil web design” I recommend checking out “ <a href="http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9781118422144/index.html">Evil By Design</a>” by Chriss Nodder.The <a href="http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9781118422144/sloth.html">Sloth section</a> goes into detail in what I am calling the fishtrap.</p>
