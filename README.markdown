## Ozzie's Blog
I've decided to migrate from Wordpress to Octopress.  

Octopress is "[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) blogging at its finest.".  So far I'm finding it quite fun and flexible, though the conversion from my Wordpress posts to Markdown is kind of exausting.  Almost there though, akmost there.

## Documentation
